            <p>Sloclap has struck gold with <strong style="color: #3ae5ad;"><i>Rematch</i></strong>, a game that feels like a true love letter to football fans. <i>Rematch</i> perfectly captures the essence of the sport, putting players in a position to feel all kinds of emotions on the pitch. The game is already impressive as is, but it's clear that there's still plenty of untapped potential. The future of <i>Rematch</i> is very promising, and so we wanted to highlight some features we'd love to see implemented into the game at some point.

            <h2>Captains — Symbolic Leadership</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Every football team has a captain. The role is ingrained in the rules of the sport. Now, <i>Rematch</i> doesn't have to be super realistic — it is a video game, after all — but leaving out something as iconic as team captaincy just feels wrong. The role would have no functional purpose in <i>Rematch</i>, but, still, it would be nice for a player to be randomly designated as captain and wearing an armband. Maybe you could even have captaincy elected by choice, if all players are from the same party.
            </p>

            <h2>Club System — A Football-Focused Spin On Guilds</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Rocket League</i> has a club system that essentially works exactly the same as any other typical guild system. <i>Rematch</i> would honestly do well to implement a similar concept. <i>Rematch</i> is a fantastic game to play with friends, so it would make sense to offer a system that helps players feel closer together. It's the kind of feature that would make the game feel more personal, which is a huge positive in terms of engagement. Custom club logos on custom club jerseys would be so cool to see while playing in ranked matches with your friends.

            <h2>Tournaments — It's Coming Home</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">At its core, football is a competitive sport where winning undoubtedly comes first. Having fun is great and all, but players want results. They want to feel rewarded for their efforts. A ranked system just isn't enough. Ranked is good for keeping players busy over a long timespan. It isn't really any good at making players feel an immediate and overwhelming sense of accomplishment. How can you resolve that? With tournaments.

            <p><i>Rematch</i> would benefit a lot from having a tournament mode. Football fans are very used to the format, so it would fit naturally into the game. The existence of trophies would provide more incentive to play, while also providing a concrete goal for players to work towards. Imagine playing in special tournaments that mimic the World Cup and the Champions League. Who wouldn't want to win those? And doing it all beside your best friends? C'mon, tournaments would be a perfect addition.</p>

            <h2>Group Training — Let People Practice Together</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Rematch</i>'s controls aren't exactly the most intuitive. If you're not playing regularly, it's going to take a few games until it feels right. The alternative is going into the free range practice mode for a little bit, but that's not all that ideal when you're in a party with friends. Making people wait never feels great. An easy solution would be to allow a party to practice together. It would be particularly helpful for players looking to improve their passing game.
            </p>

            <h2>Spectator Mode — Watching The Greats</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">Spectator modes are a helpful tool for growth. They allow players to focus on certain aspects of a game that may not come naturally to them. In <i>Rematch</i>, that might mean paying close attention to how top-level players handle goalkeeping or dribbling. Having a reference for improvement can genuinely help a lot. Just watching games for fun wouldn't hurt either. <i>Rematch</i> offers an engaging experience, whether you're playing or not.
