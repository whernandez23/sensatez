            <p>About a month ago, the <i>Stellar Blade</i> development team announced that a collab DLC with <i>Nier: Automata</i> would be coming in the near future. Now that we've gotten the chance today to get a brief look at what's to come, it's safe to say that this
               DLC will be a little bit more expansive than what was expected.
            </p>

            <p><i>Stellar Blade</i>'s <i>Nier: Automata</i> DLC will be releasing alongside a big patch update. A new Photo Mode is undoubtedly the biggest addition that will be coming to the game, but other extra content and improvements will be included, as well. <strong><i>Stellar Blade</i>'s big, new update will go live on November 20, 2024</strong>.</p>

            <h2>11 Different <i>Nier:Automata</i> Collab Items</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>Most <i>Stellar Blade</i> players probably would have expected no more than one or two 2B outfits for Eve out of the <i>Nier: Automata</i> collab, but there will actually be eleven different items available through this DLC.</p> 

            <p>Most notably, yes, Eve will be able to dress up as 2B, but there are actually alternative outfits included on top of the original 2B design that we're all used to. Interestingly, one of the outfits included is 2B's kimono outfit that was exclusive to the Nintendo Switch's version of <i>Nier: Automata</i>. Guess the developers just really like the design — who can blame them, honestly.
            </p>

            <hr class="rread-hr" id="rread-bothr">

            <p>There's more to the DLC than just different versions of 2B, though. A2 and 9S are also represented. It's worth noting that all the collab items available aren't just for Eve. Some of them are intended for other characters to wear. Lily, for example, gets the 9S outfit. Adam can wear Emil's Head. It's just nice that players can surround themselves completely with <i>Nier</i>-related content.
            </p>

            <h2>Eve Is The Perfect Model For The New Photo Mode</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>A game with such...captivating visuals just has to have a Photo Mode. It was a long time coming. A lot of attention has clearly been put into this new mode as it seems to offer a good amount of customization. It appears to have all the features you would expect out of a photo mode, and you even have control over Eve's pose and expression.</p>

            <p>It appears that you can enter Photo Mode at anytime. There have been some images related to the mode released where Eve is in the middle of combat, so it's probably safe to expect that. Considering that you can change Eve's pose, I'm expecting a lot of funny photos coming out of fights with bosses. It's also a sure thing that risqué photos will be all the craze with this Photo Mode.</p>

            <h2>Some More New Costumes Because Why Not</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>This part of the update doesn't need much explanation. Four new costumes and an accessory will become available. The new accessory, Symbol of Legacy, will change how Tachy Mode looks when equipped. The new cosmetics all look nice, definitely worth acquiring.</p> 

            <div>

            </div>

            <br>

            <p>Some other quality-of-life improvements are also included in this <i>Stellar Blade</i> patch. Lip-sync support for more languages, a "No Ponytail" option for ponytail length, and specific song selection from the turntable are a few of the "minor" updates mentioned.
            </p>

            <p>The <i>Nier: Automata</i> collab DLC and patch update for <i>Stellar Blade</i> may solely be focused on appearances, but it would be hard to expect anything more. Besides, the new <i>Nier</i> costumes look amazing. Quality is not lacking whatsoever in this upcoming content update. Again, these two things will be fully out on November 20, 2024. Certainly going to be curious about what hasn't been revealed until then.</p>
