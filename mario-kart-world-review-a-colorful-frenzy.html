      <p>Despite being something of an unconventional launch title, <strong style="color: #f3c558;"><i>Mario Kart World</i></strong> does a great job of selling the Nintendo Switch 2's enhanced capabilities. The visuals are honestly stunning for a Nintendo product, genuinely impressive even in handheld mode. The game's open-world structure and greater overall ambition also make it feel like a more than adequate leap into the next generation.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, <i>Mario Kart World</i> is not a direct upgrade over <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i>. That does need to be clearly stated. Instead, the series' familiar formula has been subverted in <i>Mario Kart World</i>. This new game focuses more on its expansive world, prioritizing exploration and touring over the more traditional 3-lap circuit experience. On a fundamental level, <i>World</i> feels like a very different kind of <i>Mario Kart</i>. With all that being said, it's still a great game — bold, ambitious, and unafraid of treading new ground.

      <h2>Enjoyability: 15/16 — Chaotic Kart Racing</h2>
      <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Mario Kart</i>, in general, is built to make you feel all kinds of emotions. <i>Mario Kart World</i> amplifies that even further, with more racers and items adding to the colorful frenzy. It's important to note, though, that the game only feels as fun as it does because the racing is actually rewarding. Success feels good — even if it's only fleeting — and <i>Mario Kart World</i> makes sure to consistently tap into that sense of accomplishment. Every race has small victories, even if you don't place all that well by the end.
      </p>

      <p><i>Mario Kart World</i> is a fantastic experience to share with family and friends, which certainly adds to the appeal. The game is easy to jump into and regularly provides chaotic, high-energy moments. What might be frustrating and annoying on your own can be really entertaining when playing with others. <i>Mario Kart World</i> fully understands what it takes to have a fun time. For the most part, it delivers exactly that.</p>

      <h2>Gameplay: 15/16 — Technically Advanced</h2>
      <p class="arh2-spc">The addition of the Charge Jump has legitimately shaped <i>Mario Kart World</i> into one of the most technically complex racing games out there. Don't worry, though; <i>Mario Kart World</i> still feels very approachable. In fact, I'd argue that the racing actually feels even more satisfying now. The game's greater focus on tricking — especially with the addition of wall and rail riding — also allows for players to express themselves more. 
      </p>

      <p>The actual racing still isn't all that complicated, but there <em>is</em> a very high skill ceiling in <i>Mario Kart World</i>. Precise, technical movements can make a huge difference on almost every course. If you like time trials, this is easily the best game for that.</p>

      <h2>Atmosphere: 6/6 — A Charming World</h2> 
      <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Mario Kart World</i> fully leans into the charm of the <i>Mario</i> universe, and it's a total delight to see. The surroundings, the music, the characters — it's pure bliss. The soundtrack, in particular, stands out for just how diverse the tracks are. From jazz to EDM, your ears are in for a good time. There's no shortage of songs either, with a lot of remixes of old tracks also included in the game. Honestly, the music alone does a stellar job of creating a deeply immersive experience.</p> 

      <p>For as much as has been said about <i>Mario Kart World</i> being too empty, it doesn't really come across that way. Sure, the world might be a bit bigger than it needs to be, but the locations have all been connected pretty naturally. There are unique sights to see all over the map, from the SNES tribute courses to the hidden UFO sites. A lot of areas celebrate the beauty of the <i>Mario</i> franchise. It's just all easy to love for the vibrant world that it is.</p>

      <h2>Design: 4/6 — Expansive Driving</h2> 
      <p class="arh2-spc">There is more to do in <i>Mario Kart World</i> than ever before. First off, there is more than just one type of race mode. Knockout Tour is a new addition to the series, and it definitely should become a mainstay. It is a nice alternative to the standard versus mode. Knockout Tour races do end up taking more time, but they do feel more rewarding to place first in. Knockout Tour embraces the chaos of <i>Mario Kart World</i> in a way that just feels right. It might actually be the definitive racing experience in this new game.

      <p>I'm sure the presence of Battle mode will satisfy some players, but the main mode of interest for those who don't want to race is Free Roam. The new mode offers a unique perspective on the environments within the game, allowing you to tour the world at your leisure. You might genuinely be surprised by how detailed a lot of courses are outside of the main track. Littered around the world are all kinds of collectibles and missions for players to enrapture themselves with. Some P-Switch missions are incredibly simple, but a lot of them interact with the environment in a fun way. Free Roam isn't anything magical, but it's a great inclusion for casual solo play.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 16.5px;">Update: As of Version 1.1.2, it is absolutely worth mentioning that <i>Mario Kart World</i>'s online has gone through a pretty major downgrade. Nintendo has explicitly made it so that players have less freedom of choice in VS Race lobbies. The 1.1.2 update has made it so that the "Random" option can no longer guarantee a 3-lap race when selected. In other words, intermission races are being forced onto players. This won't be a big deal to many players, but it's a very questionable move on Nintendo's part. Players deserve to have more choice over the complexity of the tracks they race on.</p>

      <h2>Direction: 12/16 — Inviting, But Not For Too Long</h2>
      <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Mario Kart World</i>'s biggest shortcoming is its lack of long-term appeal when playing online. The online multiplayer just doesn't do enough to keep players invested. Races can often feel more frustrating than fun, with the game leaning a bit too hard into chaotic, unpredictable action. And once you're on a bad run, there's not much to push you to play more. It's hard to find motivation sometimes when item luck makes or breaks a lot of races. These issues stand out the most in the VS Race mode, as Knockout Tour races are a little better at minimizing undeserved results.
      </p>

      <p><i>Mario Kart</i>, in general, has never been great at maintaining players' attention. At least, not in individual play sessions. But what <i>Mario Kart World</i> does excel at is its ability to keep players coming back day after day. It's easy to pick up, fundamentally fun, and offers a vibrant experience all-around. <i>Mario Kart World</i> is a fairly complete package for a racing game. There's no doubt, however, that playing with friends and family is what really makes <i>Mario Kart World</i> feel special.</p>
