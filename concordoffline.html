            <p>Sony had high hopes for <i>Concord</i>. The hero shooter had aspirations to be a leading game in the genre. But now —  just weeks after launch — Firewalk Studios has announced that <b><i>Concord</i> will be taken offline, starting September, 6, 2024.</b> 
            </p>

            <p>Unfortunately, <i>Concord</i> could not find an audience. The $40 USD price tag alone was too heavy of a commitment. But the game had problems in terms of identity as well. It wanted to be <i>Overwatch</i>, but it also wanted to be <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>. In terms of aesthetics and gameplay, it
               ultimately appealed to neither set of fans. <i>Concord</i> just doesn't stand out; it feels like a cheap knock-off that is <em>really</em> not cheap. And this is just me naming a <em>few</em> of its problems — there are way more.</p>

            <p><i>Concord</i> is an unsalvageable, commercial failure. To pull the plug this early is quite telling. While Firewalk Studios is keeping the door open for a potential return, I don't think this galaxy has a future written in its stars.</p>

            <h2>Refunds For Everyone Are Incoming</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>If you're curious about what's going to be happening in the upcoming days, a lot of it is going to be dedicated purely to refunds. Players on all platforms will be getting a full refund of the game. If you purchased a physical copy of <i>Concord</i>, it's imperative that you follow the standard procedure of the retailer you bought it from. You do <i>not</i> want to wait too long to refund a physical copy. Otherwise, PlayStation, Steam, and Epic Games will automatically take care of this situation for you.
               Just make sure that you get the proper confirmation from them.</p>

            </div>

            <br>

            <p>Sales of <i>Concord</i> have ceased immediately. It's the right thing to do and, of course, it's going to save the studio the headache of refunding people almost immediately. Regardless of your thoughts on the game, this whole process shows thoughtful consideration for the consumer. They didn't <em>have</em> to refund the game to everyone, but they're doing so because they recognize how badly they missed the mark. There are lessons to be learned here.</p>
