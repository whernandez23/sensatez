      <p>While RPGs rarely capture mainstream attention, <strong style="color: #d9bf9e;"><i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i></strong> stands out with its dynamic gameplay, gorgeous soundtrack, and mature storytelling. What makes <i>Expedition 33</i> especially compelling for an RPG is how it keeps you constantly engaged. The game shows a strong command of the genre's strengths, all while trimming away its familiar flaws.</p>

      <p><i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i>'s success is especially impressive considering that it comes from a relatively small French studio, Sandfall Interactive. This indie team has completely outdone itself, delivering a grand adventure that stands proudly alongside the finest in the RPG genre. Even with a few rough edges, <i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i> is undeniably a true work of art.</p>

      <h2>Enjoyability: 11/12 — Expedition 33 Puts All The Power In Your Hands</h2>
      <p class="arh2-spc">For a game that explores some really heavy themes, <i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i> is incredibly fun. The game just empowers you in so many different ways. Both inside and outside of combat, the player has almost complete control over their actions. The high level of engagement really does a lot for the experience, making it feel more personal. Every action also feels properly rewarding — whether it's battling a weird-looking mime for a beret or tackling a parkour challenge to earn a unique swimsuit.
      </p>

      <p><i>Expedition 33</i>'s solid groundwork ensures a consistently satisfying experience from beginning to end. Even some dozens of hours in, doing well in important fights still feels impactful and fulfilling. There's a lot of spectacle already built into the game, but the payoff is even better for those who like to think everything through. It's really hard to get tired of <i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i>, because it just offers you so much at every turn.</p>

      <h2>Gameplay: 11/12 — One Of The Most Interactive Turn-Based Games Out There</h2>
      <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i> draws heavily from JRPGs, but it forgoes the traditional turn-based battle system. The combat very much feels custom-designed. Most significantly, there isn't as much waiting. Everything still happens in turns, but battles require a lot more active participation. When it's the player's turn, character's skills become stronger if you do well on the prompted quicktime events. When it's an enemy's turn, the game gives you an opportunity — and, honestly, expects you — to react to their attacks. This system works really well, perfect for both newcomers and veterans of the genre.
      </p>

      <p>If you like having a good amount of customization available to you, <i>Expedition 33</i> has you covered. You can really get lost in making character builds. There's plenty for you to think over, from the weapons to the actual team composition. The different characters have fairly distinct playstyles, so it's worth figuring out who fits your personal preference. One thing that I will criticize is the party limit being at just 3 characters. The game is clearly balanced around that fact, but you just don't have much incentive to level up the characters who aren't in your active party. Over time, that can be a big problem.</p>

      <h2>Atmosphere: 12/12 — Unashamedly French, Unashamedly Fantastical</h2> 
      <p class="arh2-spc">One thing that quickly stands out about <i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i> is its music, and, my goodness, is it beautiful. The soundtrack will stick with you well after you're done playing. It strikes the perfect tone for every moment. All the emotions surrounding an event or area feel well represented. The level of immersion is off the charts. It's just so easy to find yourself invested in the world of The Continent. There's a constant sense of mystery to everything around you, which is exactly how this game wants you to feel.</p>

      <h2>Design: 10/12 — A Grand Continent</h2> 
      <p class="arh2-spc">It's clear that a lot of thought went into the world design of <i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i>. The main journey, in particular, comes with a good sense of progression, from start to finish. You get some good set pieces and some great visuals. Even if individual areas don't always stand out in terms of interactivity or exploration, they, at the very least, contribute to the game's tone.
      </p>

      <p>Unfortunately, what makes most areas feel properly unique is the selection of enemies available, and that's a bit of a weak point for <i>Expedition 33</i>. Encounters with unfamiliar enemies often feel frustrating when first going through a new area. It's just so easy to get blindsided by attacks you've never seen before. It's not a huge issue, but it is a bit of a drag to deal with regularly.

      <h2>Direction: 10/12 — An Expedition Worth Writing About</h2>
      <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i> initially defines itself by its story. You're pulled in by a premise that seamlessly weaves mystery with melancholy. And as the narrative unfolds through the game's first act, intrigue only rises. The more you see, the less you actually know.
      </p>

      <p><i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i> doesn't quite deliver on the thematic messages you might expect, but it still stands as a great thinkpiece. Strong emotions naturally come with this story, especially effective thanks to the game's amazing character writing. The narrative build-up might not pay off in the most pleasing way, but it's still a story worth experiencing.</p>

      <p>Where <i>Expedition 33</i> isn't so strong is in its side objectives. Even just exploring the world map feels abysmal. The walking speed in the overworld is way too slow. That alone kills a lot of incentive to explore. A lot of optional sections on the map aren't worth your time anyway. Fortunately, that all just makes it easier to stay fully invested in the main story, so it's not the worst thing ever.</p>
