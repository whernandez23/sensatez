            <p>After so many months of waiting, Nintendo has finally done it. <strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 reveal trailer has finally been released</strong>. In a video that is very intentionally 2 minutes and 22 seconds long, Nintendo has shown off all the major differences between the Switch and its upcoming successor. While no specific release date has been provided yet for the Switch 2, the console will definitively be releasing in 2025.
            </p>

            <h2>Everything New About The Switch 2</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">The most prominent change in design with the Nintendo Switch 2 is the completely changed locking system for the Joy-Cons. The Switch 2's new Joy-Cons snap into the sides of the system rather than sliding in. This is possible thanks to magnetic technology. In theory, this should be a much better design compared to what its predecessor had to offer. There is no risk of any parts deteriorating over time.</p>

            <p>There are other subtle differences in the new console. Notably, there is a new button on the right Joy-Con. Interestingly, it's just a blank square. Perhaps another look at the system might show that off better. Nintendo could very well be hiding some important information. The other changes are a little bit boring, but the new USB-C port on top is nice to have.
            </p>

            <p>Only one new game was shown off in the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal trailer, but it's a pretty big one. The next game in the <i>Mario Kart</i> series was just casually shown off, and it looks very interesting. There is a much more distinct aesthetic to the characters. Mario and Donkey Kong, for example, look a lot more stylized. If you take a look at the course, it also seems that races with up to 24 racers may now be possible. There's plenty to be excited about.</p>

            <h2>The Nintendo Switch 2 Experience Tour</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">Within North America, fans will be able to get an early hands-on experience with the Nintendo Switch 2 in three different locations: New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas. These experience tours will take place over various days. New York will be the first destination, taking place between April 4 and April 6, 2025.
            </p>

            <p>These events are free-to-enter. All you need is a Nintendo Account to register. Tickets will be handed out via a random drawing, though, so there is no guarantee for selection. Ticket registration will take place between January 17, 2025 @ 3 PM ET and January 26, 2025 @ 11:59 PM (local time for each location). You can <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/" target="_blank">register on Nintendo's site</a>.</p>

            <p>For more information about the Nintendo Switch 2, make sure to <strong>tune into the next Nintendo Direct on April 2, 2025</strong>. Nintendo will likely cover various different things about the system then. There should also be some fun, new games shown off — exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2, of course.</p>
