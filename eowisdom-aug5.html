            </div>
            <br> 
            <p>This morning, a new trailer for <i>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</i> dropped and, naturally, we have to break it down. There was a lot that Nintendo was able to showcase in just over five minutes so, trust me, there are all kinds of different talking points. <i>Echoes of Wisdom</i> appears to be a celebration of Zelda's entire history, offering something of interest for both new and longtime fans — these reveals are definitely going to turn some heads.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Hyrule, Home of Many — Deku Scrubs, Gerudo, Gorons, and Zora All Represented</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>It's been a <i>long</i> time since all the major <i>Zelda</i> races were represented in the same game. <i>Echoes of Wisdom</i> actually takes it one step further with the inclusion of both sea and river Zora, something that has never been done before.</p>

            <p>Each of these races will have their own unique location that they will call home in <i>Echoes of Wisdom</i>. The Gerudo will, of course, reside in the <b>Gerudo Desert</b>. The sea and river Zora live in different villages amidst the <b>Jabul Waters</b>. Goron City is nestled somewhere along <b>Eldin Volcano's</b> cliffsides. <b>Kakariko Village</b> is at the base of that mountain. And, finally, the Deku Scrubs live in the swamp-jungle hybrid known as the <b>Faron Wetlands</b>.
            </p>

            <p>Even from just the limited footage we've seen, I think it's fairly safe to assume that all these different races will have a big part to play in this game. They're not just here to decorate the setting. We've seen a little too many royal figures to think otherwise.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>Main Quests and Side Quests — Do What You Want</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>Okay, this doesn't need much in-depth explanation. In <i>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</i>, players will find themselves being tasked with different quests after interacting with people all over Hyrule. You will either get main quests which will progress the story or you'll get side quests which are totally optional. It's unclear if there are any rewards that you can get out of these side quests at this time, but there will most likely be something to gain from completing them.
               It's just what you'd expect from a <i>Zelda</i> game.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Travel Made Easy — Horses and Waypoints</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>The horses in this game are absolutely adorable. They may not be Epona, but they're just as valuable when it comes to traversing Hyrule. Once you have the ability to create carrot echoes, you can call upon the horses at any time and any place to help you along your journey. They move faster than Zelda and can also jump over small obstacles with greater ease. Fences are no problem for the horses.</p>

            <p>If you just need to get to a set location, then waypoints will be your best friend. Once you've activated them, you'll be able to fast travel back to the waypoint whenever you need to. They're not too difficult to come by, but you can't exactly depend on them entirely. They seem to be primarily positioned outside of major locations only.
            </p>

               <img src="images/eowisdom-aug5_horse.jpg" width="100%" class="center" alt="Princess Zelda riding a horse">
            </div>

            <br>
            <h2>Accessories and Clothing — Equipment Done Differently</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>Princess Zelda isn't Link. That much should be obvious to just about everyone. That means that the same ol' equipment system just wouldn't work in <i>Echoes of Wisdom</i>. And, indeed, it has been changed to suit Zelda a little bit more. You won't be finding any new weapons or tools in the overworld to manage as equipment. Instead, there are accessories that you can collect — each of them granting their own unique effect.
               They don't seem <i>that</i> impactful, but what can you really do when echoes have so much power?</p>

            <p>You can also acquire clothing for Zelda to wear. They seem to only exist for cosmetic purposes, but there's no harm in that at all. Hopefully, there's more than just the 3 options we've seen, though.
            </p>

            </div>

            <br>
            <h2>A New Ability — Bind</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>The last thing of note to talk about is the newly revealed ability, <b>Bind</b>. When echoes aren't enough, the ability, Bind, can get you out of the bind. It allows you to move an object as Zelda moves. Anything indestructible can simply be moved aside. Or, if you find a buried treasure chest, you can use the ability to pull it out of the ground. Bind is very convenient and is definitely going to be integral to many puzzles in the game.</p>

            <p>As if that weren't enough, you also have access to reverse bonds. This allows you to follow an object's movement instead of having it follow you. This effectively works out as another means of travel. With the right echoes, you can basically fly or climb up any wall. It is very empowering.
            </p>

            </div>
               
            <br>
            <p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</i> is a game to be taken seriously. That's my main takeaway from the trailer. Nothing about the game suggests that it is being treated like a spin-off by the developers. On the contrary, it seems very deep on a mechanical level. There is no doubt that this is the next big journey in <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>. Honestly, I can't wait for it.
            </p>

            <p>I'm excited. I hope you're excited. We'll see you again when there's some more news concerning the game.</p>
