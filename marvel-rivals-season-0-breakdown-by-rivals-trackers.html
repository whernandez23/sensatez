            </div>
            <br> 
            <p>By merely playing <i>Marvel Rivals</i> alone, it's hard to get an accurate assessment of the game's meta. Just one interaction with an Iron Man or an Iron Fist could leave a lasting impression on you. Now, the opinions of top players do help, but they're people all the same. Their opinions can also be misinformed; though, you'll get a lot closer to the truth.
            </p>

            <p>What all players can turn to for the best results are the various <i>Marvel Rivals</i> trackers that have begun to pop up, including <a href="https://rivalsmeta.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #FBE89D;">Rivals Meta</a> and <a href="https://rivalstracker.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #FBE89D;">Rivals Tracker</a>. The data isn't exactly infallible, but it excellently summarizes the current state of the game. That being said, it's important to understand that these <i>Rivals</i> trackers are just tools for deeper analysis.
               It shouldn't impact all your decision-making when it comes to playing the game.

            <h2><i>Marvel Rivals</i> Stats Revealed: Season 0 Character Tier List</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Marvel Rivals</i> has a lot of powerful heroes. In earnest, the majority of the roster can give you a true winning effort. A few names do stand out among the rest, though. <a href="https://rivalsmeta.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #FBE89D;">Rivals Meta</a> and <a href="https://rivalstracker.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #FBE89D;">Rivals Tracker</a> are both great sites to visit to help identify the best of the best. I mean, how else would you find out that <em>Magik</em>, of all characters, actually has the best win rate in the game right now?</p> 

            <p>But even with a bunch of data, determining the best characters in the game can be a bit arbitrary. Do you go by win rate? Or do you go by ban rate? Maybe a mix of both? Well, at the highest level, you can go strictly by the order of Ban Rate% available on the <i>Rivals</i> trackers. Ban Rate% tells you how good a character can be at their peak. Elsewhere, a perfect blend of the two rate stats paints a better picture of the general performance of a character.</p>

            <p><strong>Hawkeye, for example, is the character that is most frequently banned in <i>Marvel Rivals</i></strong>. When taking all Hawkeye competitive games into account, however, he actually wins at a below-average rate. Relative to the rest of the roster, of course. Hela, on the other hand, doesn't see this problem. She is consistently a top performer.</p>

            <p>The tier list below might seem a bit odd at first, but it accounts for these differences in consistency. Every character is ranked in order, so <strong>Luna Snow, for example, ranks as the 7th-best character in the game</strong>.</p>

              <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong><em>5 Best Characters</em></strong>: Hela, Hulk, Black Panther, Hawkeye, Mantis</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong><em>5 Worst Characters</em></strong>: Black Widow, Squirrel Girl, Captain America, Venom, Scarlet Witch</li>

            <h2>The <i>Rivals</i> Team-Up Meta: Team-Up Success Rates</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">Team composition matters in hero shooters. Team-ups in <i>Marvel Rivals</i> can really make a big difference in matches. Taking advantage of them can substantially increase the consistency of your team strategies. The most optimal ones heavily shift things in your favor.
            </p>

            <p>The team-ups in <i>Rivals</i> aren't exactly made equally, though. There is quite a substantial difference between the best team-up and the worst team-up. For reference, <strong>the worst-team up in the game is Hawkeye and Black Widow's, which sports an abysmal win rate of 32.53%</strong>. Those two together are just unplayable â€” the opposite of a winning strategy.</p>

            <p>The average team-up results in a positive win record. A few of them are troubled by the fact, though, that one or more of the characters involved aren't usually good. Jeff, in particular, makes his team-ups look worse on average. <strong>The best team-up in the game involves all good characters, those being Adam Warlock, Star Lord, and Mantis</strong>. Their team-up has a staggering win rate of 61.81%. That's beyond competitive.</p>

            <h2>Tracking Your Marvel Rivals Profile: Reveal Important Stats</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Marvel Rivals</i> does a pretty good job of displaying the stats you want to see. Kills, assists, and damage, you don't generally need to get complicated with it. If you want to go slightly more in-depth with your record, though, <i>Marvel Rivals</i> trackers have got you covered. The information is easy to look at and incredibly accessible so long as you have your <i>Marvel Rivals</i> UID.</p> 

            <p>To find your UID, you want to go to your Career page in the game. Within your Overview, you should be able to find your UID to the right of your in-game name. If you want to look at the stats of your favorite streamers, you can follow the same method. You would just search for <em>their</em> UID instead. Rivals Meta has a nice feature where you can see a player's most common teammates. It's a great way to quickly look at your friends' profiles.</p>
