            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
               <p>For any business inquiries, comments, or concerns,
                  you can reach out to <b>sensatez.hr@gmail.com</b>.
               </p>

               <p>We accept paid/sponsored posts on this site. Terms can be mutually agreed upon.</p>

            <h2>Why the name 'Sensatez'?</h2>
            <p>In Spanish, the word means something along the lines of "reasonableness" or "sensibleness." In an age where 
              divisive opinions are uber popular to generate clicks, this site aims to look at every game fairly. Reviews 
              are always going to be subjective. Opinions, by nature, are totally subjective. But it is absolutely possible
              to look at the different elements of a game and recognize how it may appeal to some and not for others. In 
              other words, we want to be sensible in how we cover all kinds of different games to make sure everyone feels
              like their sentiments are being recognized. Thus, the name 'Sensatez.'
            </p>

            <h2>E.G.A.D.D. - Our Review Metric System</h2>
            <p>Not to be confused with the kooky, old scientist from the <i>Luigi's Mansion</i> series, E.G.A.D.D. is the system 
               we will be using to review games on this site.</p>
            
            <p>This is what E.G.A.D.D. stands for:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li class="about-list">E - <b>Enjoyability</b> - How fun is the game as an experience from start to finish? What does the game do to keep things interesting?</li>
              <li class="about-list">G - <b>Gameplay</b> - How interesting is the core gameplay loop? Does it feel good to do what the game asks of you?</li>
              <li class="about-list">A - <b>Atmosphere</b> - How much does the environment, mood, and sound design come together to amplify your experience with the game?</li>
              <li class="about-list">D - <b>Design</b> - How well-thought-out are different sections of the game? How well does the game evolve over time?</li>
              <li class="about-list">D - <b>Direction</b> - How good is the game at pushing its players to keep playing? Are objectives and the narrative clear to follow?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now, of course, the definitions for these terms may be different depending on who you ask. But for our intents and
            purposes, we will stick to these definitions here. These five elements when put together feel like an accurate way of
            assessing how good a game is, no matter the genre. We will be subjective in our reviews, but with this system we also
            aim to more objectively measure each game's strengths and weaknesses so that readers can better evaluate if it may appeal to them.
            Multiplayer-heavy games cannot be evaluated the same as single-player games and so, you may end up seeing these elements
            weighed differently depending on the type of game being reviewed. This is done to better reflect players' expectations when getting 
            into these kinds of games. Atmosphere is probably not at the forefront of someone's mind when getting into a sports game, for example.</p>

            <h2>Images and Videos</h2>
            <p>Images and videos on this site may either be produced in-house or taken from the general public. We will 
               properly cite any media that requires it, but that may not be possible in certain cases.</p>

               <h2>Social Media</h2>
               <p>Currently, we only have an X (Twitter) account and a YouTube account. Managing all these different platforms isn't exactly the easiest thing so apologies if posts and updates
                  are a bit slow to reach those platforms.
               </p>

               <h2>Write for Us!</h2>
              <p>If you would like to write for this website, we would be happy to have you on our team. Currently, we cannot pay for any guest-written articles as this website is still very young, but we would be 
                 more than happy to be part of your online portfolio. There <i>is</i> a form of standard that comes with writing articles on here so we expect a good amount of revisions on your part, but we will 
                 ultimately handle any final editing before publishing. In terms of the content that you would be writing about, that is pretty open. While we prioritize very recent news and games for reviews, we're pretty
                 flexible so long as the idea is coherent. Regardless, ideas should always be discussed before you start any writing. You can reach out to the email shown below. Again, we would be very happy to have you writing for us!
