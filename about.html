            <h2>Why the name 'Sensatez'?</h2>
            <p>In Spanish, the word means something along the lines of "reasonableness" or "sensibleness." In an age where 
              divisive opinions are uber popular to generate clicks, this site aims to look at every game fairly. Reviews 
              are always going to be subjective. Opinions, by nature, are totally subjective. But it is absolutely possible
              to look at the different elements of a game and recognize how it may appeal to some and not for others. In 
              other words, we want to be sensible in how we cover all kinds of different games to make sure everyone feels
              like their sentiments are being recognized. Thus, the name 'Sensatez.'
            </p>

            <h2>E.G.A.D.D. - Our Review Metric System</h2>
            <p>Not to be confused with the kooky, old scientist from the <i>Luigi's Mansion</i> series, E.G.A.D.D. is the system 
               we will be using to review games on this site.</p>
            
            <p>This is what E.G.A.D.D. stands for:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li class="about-list">E - <b>Enjoyability</b> - How fun is the game as an experience from start to finish? What does the game do to keep things interesting?</li>
              <li class="about-list">G - <b>Gameplay</b> - How interesting is the core gameplay loop? Does it feel good to do what the game asks of you?</li>
              <li class="about-list">A - <b>Atmosphere</b> - How much does the environment, mood, and sound design come together to amplify your experience with the game?</li>
              <li class="about-list">D - <b>Design</b> - How well-thought-out are different sections of the game? How well does the game evolve over time?</li>
              <li class="about-list">D - <b>Direction</b> - How good is the game at pushing its players to keep playing? Are objectives and the narrative clear to follow?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now, of course, the definitions for these terms may be different depending on who you ask. But for our intents and
            purposes, we will stick to these definitions here. These five elements when put together feel like an accurate way of
            assessing how good a game is, no matter the genre. We will be subjective in our reviews, but with this system we also
            aim to more objectively measure each game's strengths and weaknesses so that readers can better evaluate if it may appeal to them.
            Multiplayer-heavy games cannot be evaluated the same as single-player games and so, you may end up seeing these elements
            weighed differently depending on the type of game being reviewed. This is done to better reflect players' expectations when getting 
            into these kinds of games. Atmosphere is probably not at the forefront of someone's mind when getting into a sports game, for example.</p>
