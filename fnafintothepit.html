      <br>
      <p>Just in time for the ten year anniversary, the <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i> franchise has
        released its newest installment: <i>Into the Pit</i>. A horror game in the style of a retro, pixelated
        adventure, <i>Into the Pit</i> brings to life the first and most popular book in the <i>Fazbear Frights</i>
        series. Following a young boy named Oswald trying to save his father
        from the series' main villain, Springtrap, <i>Into the Pit</i> introduces a whole new world for
        the <i>FNAF</i> franchise that we've never seen before. From time traveling ball pits to
        the more standard jumpscares, this game has both everything and nothing we've been looking for from this iconic
        horror series.</p>

      <p><i>Into the Pit</i> is a good game. Its unique gameplay style (for the series), beautiful
        visuals, and spot-on sound design place it as one of the strongest games in the <i>FNAF</i>
        franchise. On the other hand, it suffers from a lot of the issues that modern video games, especially games in this category, deal with. Mired by a repetitive and sometimes frustrating
        gameplay loop and bugs that haven't been patched out yet, you can see that this game had a lot
        of love put into it but it could've stayed in the oven for a little longer.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Enjoyability: 10/12</h2>
      <br>
      <p>While there are a few issues with the general bugginess of the game, the actual
        gameplay is fun. The constant threat of an animatronic looming just off screen keeps the
        game exciting and never lets your attention slip. Not only that but the game is genuinely
        funny during the calmer moments, with the franchise's dry and youthful sense of humor on full display.
      </p>

      <p>For as much as the game sticks out to me compared to the other <i>FNAF</i> games, it's not the
        strongest as a standalone game. The music doesn't stick out to me as much as the gory and
        creepy sound effects do. And as much as I love the pixelated-style of the game, the depth
        perception and character movement can feel a bit clunky. It's a fun game, sure, but there
        were definitely times where all I wanted was to move onto the next part of the story. Constantly getting inconvenienced by the likes of Chica and Springtrap loses its allure pretty quickly.</p>

      <p>That being said, there is a mode before the gameplay starts where you can choose
        to stay more focused on the narrative part of the story. That's a great option to have in terms of replayability,
        especially if you're like me and get impatient with all the hiding.</p>

      <br>  
      <h2>Gameplay: 9/12</h2>
      <br>
      <p><i>FNAF</i> as a franchise is all about gameplay loops. It practically invented its own genre
        which has been copied hundreds of times over. Switching things up like they have with
        <i>Into the Pit</i> is no doubt a positive in terms of staying fresh. Like I've mentioned before, the game is fun
        and the story is interesting; however, the gameplay loop can be irritating and sometimes it can just completely kill all motivation
        to keep playing. It's satisfying when you succeed — when you finally
        move on to the next part of the story or complete whatever task that was being asked of you. Failure is most likely going to be part of your journey, though. And it will totally rain on your parade.</p>

      <p>It feels like everything you do you're doing for a reason, and it makes sense in the context of the
        story why you're going back and forth looking for the next objective. You're never left
        aimless, which is appreciated since wandering around the pizzeria is my main gripe with the
        gameplay.</p>

      <p>You simply have no real way of defending yourself besides hiding, which is my biggest
        issue. You spend <i>so much</i> time hiding under tables or in vents or chests while the
        animatronics wander around you. While you wait for them to leave your section of the
        restaurant, there's nothing for you to do. All you can do is wait. Then, wait some more. Then, you can finally play the game again. I also have a personal grudge against
        Chica for being the biggest tattle-tale on Earth. She also happens to serve no other purpose despite how much she
        lingers around so...just leave me alone, Chica.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Atmosphere: 11/12</h2>
      <br>
      <p>This is where the game really shines. It's a great game to look at, with its nostalgic
        pixelated style and beautiful atmospheric lighting. Whenever you hit an important point of the
        story or you get killed, you get a short animated cutscene in that pixelated style which usually
        features one of the animatronics; all such animations are expertly done. I appreciate the new
        direction that they took with this game, given that it's such a hard switch from the last
        installment, <i>Security Breach</i>. I do think it's a stylistic improvement, honestly. It gives the game
        character and left me wishing for more locations to explore just so I could see how they
        would be designed in this old, rickety style of <i>Into the Pit</i>.</p>

      <p>The sound design is also something to enjoy. While the music in and of itself is
         forgettable, there's something to be said for the creepiness that the sounds bring to the
         game. Springtrap's raspy breathing whenever he's close and the trapped children screaming
         for help was effectively scary, and the atmospheric sounds of the animatronics moving
         around you are actually important, gameplay-wise. It's the kind of game that can't be
         played silently.</p>

      <div>
         <img src="images/fnafintothepit_bck.jpg" width="100%" class="center" alt="The familiar pizzeria setting can be quite haunting">
      </div>
      <br>
      <h2>Design: 8/12</h2>
      <br> 
      <p>There's something to be said about the level of engagement of the game and while I do
        think it's worthy of being played through in its entirety, there's not much behind the surface.
        There's no depth when it comes to the gameplay and not much strategy besides hiding in a
        convenient spot and utilizing the sound items to attract animatronics around the restaurant. The replayability is there, especially with its multiple
        endings, special collectibles, and hidden achievements. But that all depends on you wanting to actually play the game again.
      </p>

      <p>There are changes made to each night that add on to the complexity and difficulty of navigating the pizzeria. As the nights progress, more animatronics are introduced to you. Where have I seen that before...This 
         means that you have to be mindful of more gameplay elements as you progress through the game. You'll first get introduced to Chica and then you'll slowly go through the list. 
         They're not all made as equally as relevant, though, so the actual evolution of the gameplay is pretty lackluster, to put it kindly.</p>

      <div> 
         <img src="images/fnafintothepit_draw.jpg" width="100%" class="center" alt="Springtrap will often interrupt your attempts to complete the objective">
      </div>

      <br>  
      <h2>Direction: 10/12</h2>
      <br>
      <p>In my experience, I do think that there's enough there storywise to carry the game
        through to the end. The main objective of finding Oswald's father in the pizzeria is something
        that kept me engaged the whole time and kept me wanting to continue playing. Additionally,
        each night you spend part of the time in the pizzeria saving other children who've been
        trapped there by the animatronics; I think that was a successful and satisfying way to keep
        the player engaged and it does make you feel like you're making progress.
      </p>

      <p>There's always a clear objective to complete, some more complicated and thought
        provoking than others, but I think it always generally encourages players to keep going. There's not much room to get lost. Also, I think the general <i>FNAF</i> motif
        of there being five nights in each game gives the player a pretty clear ending that they can aim for.
        The overall objective is never forgotten and Oswald reminds the player of their purpose in the pizzeria more than frequently. That continues to drive the point home that if the player gives up now
        they'll never know what really happened to Oswald's dad on the day he was taken.
      </p>
