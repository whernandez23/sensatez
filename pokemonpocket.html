            <p>The Pokémon TCG will finally be available on mobile devices for all to enjoy...Or at least, that's what I would say if that statement were wholly true. Truth of the matter is, the Pokémon TCG <i>already has been</i> available on-the-go ever since the days of <i>Pokémon TCG Online</i>. That game was eventually replaced by <i>Pokémon TCG Live</i> which is the current live service. Unless you're an avid fan of the TCG, though, I'd be surprised if you've ever
              even seen what those games look like.
            </p>

            <p><i>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</i> appears to be designed with a lot more ambitious goals, attempting to appeal to a grander audience. The greater emphasis on card collecting and illustration rare cards certainly should help as it provides players something to look forward to beyond the gameplay. The inclusion of quick battles, which simplify and streamline the traditional TCG rules, will also make the game a lot more accessible and a lot...quicker.
               It's certainly a lot more user-friendly and a lot more marketable and that can really go a long way.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>User Experience Forward</h2>  
            <br>
            <p>Graphically, <i>Pocket</i> seems to be a whole level above its predecessors. It definitely seems to be designed with the intention of being functional <b>and</b> pretty. We can't really say if there will be more complex animations for the cards in battle just yet, but I would say that the effects that we've seen so far strike a good balance between being visually appealing and non-disruptive to the pace of the game. This was a pretty big problem before so 
              it's good to see that players likely won't need to worry about that here. Outside of battle, you can look through the cards in your collection and marvel at their beauty. Certain illustration rare cards also seem to have become "immersive cards" that allow you to effectively leap into the world of the card's illustration. We got a brief preview in the trailer and it looks <b>impressive</b>. <i>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</i> also promises the ability 
              to trade with friends which is in no way a standard feature for a digital collectible card game. Everyone knows that there's no better way to bond than to trade the Pokémon cards you undervalue. All in all, <i>Pocket</i> has the chance to be big. Real big.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>Pokémon cards were never appealing because of what you were supposed to do with them. People honestly love them just for what they represent. They just look nice - even better when they're someone's favorite Pokémon. <i>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</i> seems to understand that fairly well and part of its philosophy is built around that basic concept. This isn't supposed to be a niche mobile game. This is supposed to become <i>the</i> mobile card game.
               Chances are, if they invest enough into the game, they can absolutely find great success here.
