            <p>The video game industry <i>loves</i> remakes, and Atlus looks about ready to spoil <i>Persona</i> fans with another one in the near future. <strong style="color: #fff100;"><i>Persona 4</i></strong> is set to receive a remake some time soon. We know this to be the case from various different sources, ranging from insiders to an official domain registration. Let's break down all the signs that point to an imminent <i>Persona 4</i> remake.

            <h2>An Unannounced Game And A Singer Known For Persona 4</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Leakers have suggested for a while now that multiple <i>Persona</i> projects are being developed at the same time. While it's easy to say that an unannounced game is currently being worked on, evidence of an upcoming <i>Persona 4</i> remake actually does exist. To a degree.
            </p>

            <p>Shihoko Hirata is a singer who is best known in the video game industry for her work on <i>Persona 4</i>. Back in February 2025, Hirata casually revealed that she was working on an unannounced project. The studio that she was recording in, MIT STUDIO (Studio 2), happens to also be a popular spot for the recording of <i>Persona</i> soundtracks. The studio seems to be a stronghold for Sega, in general. Sure, it could all be a coincidence, but it lines up too perfectly.</p>

            <p><i>Persona 3 Reload</i> re-recorded its soundtrack, so the same could be expected of a <i>Persona 4</i> remake. <i>Reload</i> also introduced new songs to the soundtrack, which would also be a good reason for a <i>Persona 4</i> remake to bring back Shihoko Hirata. She hasn't worked on any other games by the looks of things, so all the signs point towards <i>Persona 4</i>.</p>

            <h2>Domain Registration â€” <i>Persona 3 Reload</i> Is A Strong Precedent</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">3 months prior to <i>Persona 3 Reload</i>'s official reveal, the domain, p3re.jp, was registered by Atlus. History looks to be repeating itself as the domain, p4re.jp, was created on March 20, 2025. The registrant isn't listed by request, however. That's exactly what Atlus would do to hide its involvement in the domain registration. This domain isn't exactly clear-cut evidence of the inevitability of a <i>Persona 4</i> remake, but the only precedent that we know of sure points to that being the case.

            <p>Many <i>Persona</i> fans are surely waiting for <i>Persona 6</i>, but I'm not sure any would complain if a <i>Persona 4</i> remake ends up releasing beforehand. I wouldn't expect much to be changed, but a visual revamp alone would be pretty nice. I wonder what it'll be called, though. <i>Persona 4 Reveal</i>, maybe? Your guess is as good as mine.</p>
