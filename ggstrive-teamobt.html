            <p>If you've been interested in getting into <i>Guilty Gear -Strive-</i>, well, now is a great opportunity to do so free of charge. The team at Arc System Works will be conducting a network open beta test which will allow players to try out the new "Team of 3" mode in online battles. It's a completely new mode so it's going to take some getting used to on everyone's part. The open beta test will be live between <b>July 25, 2024 7 P.M. PT</b> and <b>July 29, 2024 12:00 AM PT</b>. It's available to download as a standalone application on all platforms right now. Get to it.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Open Beta Test Details â€” What's Included?</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>You're probably wondering, "Who can I play?" That's always a great question to ask when it comes to fighting games. In this open beta test, players will be able to play as all 28 characters currently available in <i>Guilty Gear -Strive-</i>, including DLC. The generosity is very much appreciated.

            <p>Another major question on your mind might be about the specifics of this new mode. It isn't just <i>Guilty Gear</i>, but with 3 characters on your side; it's a little bit different from that. For one, all characters on the team will share the same health bar. What incentivizes you to switch are Skills and Break-Ins which only the Assist characters (the characters who don't start the round) are able to use. What's going to stop you from just switching all the time, though, is the fact that the Main character (the character who starts the round) can only fight once per round.
               There's also a tag system in place where you can temporarily fight with two characters at once. Honestly, this is all a bit hard to explain; it's best to just play the game to experience it for yourself.</p>
