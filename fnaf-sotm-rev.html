            <p>Steel Wool Studios has not disappointed with today's scheduled announcement. A brand new, official <i>Five Nights At Freddy's</i> game has been revealed and it's expected to be released in <b>2025</b>. <i>Five Nights At Freddy's: Secret Of The Mimic</i> will be the newest installment in the franchise and it seemingly will take us back in time, perhaps to explore more of The Mimic's origins. If you have no clue who that is, we can quickly bring you up to speed.
               It helps to revisit the lore anyway, as it may provide clues about the upcoming game's setting and storyline.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Who On Earth Is The Mimic?</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>If you've not played any of the recent <i>Five Nights At Freddy's</i> games, then, chances are, you probably have no idea who The Mimic is. It might surprise you to find out that the character's origins actually trace back to the mystery horror novel series, <i>Tales from the Pizzaplex</i>. Yeah, the books definitively matter for the <i>FNAF</i> canon these days.</p>

            <p>The Mimic is an AI-powered robot that was designed to learn and "grow" by mimicking what it saw. Originally, The Mimic's sole purpose was to serve as a companion for the young son of its creator</b>. It served that purpose more than well, demonstrating some semblance of autonomy and a great capacity to copy the son's behaviors. But when that boy passed away after getting struck by a van, those copied behaviors were too much for The Mimic's creator to handle.
               Rage and sheer anger got the best of him, resulting in a violent disfiguring of the robot. Of course, The Mimic could never possibly forget that moment. That would not be the end of the robot. 
            </p>

            <p>The Mimic was given a second life by a group of animatronic engineers from Fazbear Entertainment. The Mimic was fixed up with a new pair of legs to boot. It showed its thanks by ruthlessly killing the workers. It was consumed by murderous intent, using all of its past knowledge to make all those men suffer in unique ways. Something else that The Mimic developed was an aptitude for deception. It would hide in costumes and copy people's voices; anything to get
               the upper hand. The Mimic is an absolute monster.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>Saying anything more about The Mimic would get into spoiler territory which I really don't want to do. Part of the fun with <i>Five Nights At Freddy's</i> games is the chase for the truth, but there's still so much time left until the next game's release. Let's just be patient with Steel Wool Studios. When it's time to impress us, they will.
