            <p><i>Pokémon TCG Pocket</i>'s first shiny-focused set, <i>Shining Revelry</i>, may seem to be all style and no substance, but there's plenty of the depth to the looks. Under all the sparkles are some very competent cards. Now, which are the most important chase cards in <i>Shining Revelry</i>? There are plenty of good cards available, but here are some of the best that you can get.

            <h2>Team Rocket Grunt —  The Inverse Misty</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Before any other card in <i>Shining Revelry</i> can be mentioned, we absolutely need to talk about <strong style="color: #94f996;">Team Rocket Grunt</strong>. The best Supporter cards in <i>Pokémon TCG Pocket</i> can shift a match in your favor, and that's exactly what this card does. <strong>Team Rocket Grunt allows you to discard random Energy from your opponent's Active Pokémon</strong>...so long as you get lucky with coin flips.
            </p>

            <p>Team Rocket Grunt essentially serves as an inverse Misty. It's an incredible defensive tool that can win games on its own. Team Rocket Grunt's effect may only prove useful less than 50% of the time, but you absolutely should take that gamble. Team Rocket Grunt can both save you in a pinch, and stop your opponent's strategy before it can even properly get underway. That kind of value is, well, invaluable.</p>

            <h2>Beedrill ex — More Disruption For Cheap</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc"><strong style="color: #d2fe7b;">Beedrill ex</strong> isn't a very complex card. It's a Stage 2 Pokémon with a good amount of health (170 HP), an attack that costs just 2 Energy, and a very cheap retreat cost of just 1 Energy. All these attributes alone make Beedrill ex, at the very least, playable. What makes the card especially good, though, is the effect of its one move. 
            </p>

            <p><strong>Beedrill ex's attack, Crushing Spear, discards a random Energy from the opponent's Active Pokémon</strong>. If your opponent still needs time to set up, Beedrill ex can actually make a big difference. After all, removing energy from your opponent's Active Pokémon should prevent Beedrill from taking big hits, while doing good damage in the process. Combine Beedrill ex with Team Rocket Grunt and you can very quickly neuter your opponent's advantage.</p>

            <h2>Wugtrio ex — Water Dragonite</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Dragonite is good, but <strong style="color: #6d80f7;">Wugtrio ex</strong> is everything that card wants to be and more. Wugtrio ex solves Dragonite's problem with consistency by being a Water-type, which benefits from the existence of Misty. <strong>Wugtrio ex only needs 3 Energy to dish out 150 (albeit, undirected) damage</strong>. That's nothing to scoff at. Only needing 1 Energy to retreat also offers more flexibility when it comes to strategy.
               Wugtrio ex might not be a seamless fit into any Water-type deck, but the card is a fantastic option to consider building around.
            </p>

            <h2>Gholdengo — Heavy Metal Damage</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc"><strong style="color: #ffe033;">Gholdengo</strong> gives the Metal-type a very solid attacking option by simply being <strong>the Metal counterpart to Celebi ex</strong>. They pretty much have the exact same effect, just different typings. While Celebi ex has Serperior as its favorite companion, Gholdengo has Dialga ex. Not a downgrade in effectivity at all.

            <p>Dialga ex makes for a great Energy outlet for Gholdengo, able to provide up to 2 Energy every turn. Dialga does need to get access to Metallic Turbo, though, which can be a bit hard to put into play sometimes. But just within a few turns, you can have a bonafide nuke in your hands. Gholdengo isn't an ex Pokémon, so you don't even have too much to lose if the card ends up getting knocked out. Gholdengo has been very generously designed to help Metal decks.</p>

            <h2>Iono — Mutual Mulligan</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">If you've got a bad hand, <strong style="color: #d1e9e9;">Iono</strong> can fix that easily for you. That's mainly how she'll end up getting used, at least. There <i>is</i> room to use her as more of a defensive tool, but improving your own hand will be more useful 9 out of 10 times.
            </p>

            <p>There really are no downsides to using Iono, so long as the timing is right. <strong>If you need to fish for any particular card, that's a good enough time to reset your hand with Iono</strong>. If drawing that one specific card can really make a difference, you especially should go for it. Having an actual chance to get that card is what makes Iono so good. Generating advantage for yourself is always valuable.</p>
