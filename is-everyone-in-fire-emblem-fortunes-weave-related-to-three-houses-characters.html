            <p>Just a single <strong style="color: #fee1d1">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</strong> trailer has given fans plenty to speculate about. With so much crucial information missing, attempts to connect the dots are really all that can be done. Sothis' presence in the trailer especially demands much attention, linking the new game directly to <i>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</i>.</p>

            <p>The existence of Crests in <i>Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</i> only further establishes a connection to <i>Three Houses</i>. Dietrich, one of the new characters in <i>Fortune's Weave</i>, makes that link unmistakable. A direct reference to one of the lineages in <i>Three Houses</i> opens a huge door of possibilities. Is everyone in <i>Fortune's Weave</i> somehow related to the characters in <i>Three Houses</i>?</p>

            <h2>Dietrich And The Crest Of Lamine</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Dietrich is one of the few characters in the first trailer shown with a Crest. He notably has the Crest of Lamine, the same one that Mercedes and Jeritza both have in <i>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</i>. The resemblance is definitely there, leading to the easy conclusion that they must be related.</p>

            <p>Even beyond looks, Dietrich has the skill, Murderous Intent. This isn't new or unique to him, as Jeritza actually has the same skill (as the Death Knight). Jeritza's struggles with murderous tendencies have long been attributed to his experienced trauma, but Dietrich's sadistic personality seems to suggest that an affinity for it might just run in the family.</p>

            <p>It would be nice to know what Dietrich's exact relation is to Mercedes and Jeritza, but that's still up in the air. For now, we just know that there is some kind of blood connection there. Dietrich's unique weapon, the Answerer, doesn't help, only presenting more questions about the time period in which <i>Fortune's Weave</i> takes place. A relic weapon that we've never seen before — how is that possible?</p>

There is no doubt that he is related to them in some way.">

          <h2>The Divine Sovereign And The Nabateans</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">At a first glance, the Divine Sovereign appears to be a standard Nabatean. His blondish-green hair is consistent with how characters like Rhea, Seteth, and Flayn used to look. His ears are also a perfect match; though, he interestingly doesn't hide them.
            </p>

            <p>The Divine Sovereign's blue eyes are unique, however, and that inconsistency in design seems important. The other Nabateans have distinctly green eyes. Could he be something else entirely then? From a wholly different family of dragons? Or just heavily diluted Nabatean blood, perhaps?</p>

            <p>One theory suggests that the Divine Sovereign is a descendant or artificial clone of Byleth. The deep blue eyes and the dragon blood are the main connections there. In a descendant or clone, it's possible that Byleth's fused genes would present themselves differently, passing on a mix of traits. The theory is a bit of a reach, but it's plausible.</p>

            <h2>Cai And Yuri</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">While Dietrich might look almost exactly like the Lamine Creast bearers that fans are acquainted with, Cai's relation to Yuri isn't quite so clear. There aren't any obvious visual similarities. It's also significant to point out that the Crest of Aubin isn't associated with any family lines. The only reason that Yuri even has the Crest is because Aubin personally gave it to him.
            </p>

            <p>In self-exile, Aubin lived the end of his life as a nomad. It's feasible then that he passed on his blood to another person in a different part of the world. For the moment, though, it's not too absurd to think that Cai may be related to Yuri. The argument for that just isn't very strong.</p>

            <div>
               <img src="images/is-everyone-in-fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-related-to-three-houses-characters_cai-yuri.jpg" width="100%" class="center" alt="Cai may not look like Yuri, but they do both have the Crest of Aubin. It's plausible that they have no connection at all, though.">

            <h2>Leda And Hapi</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Design-wise, Leda vaguely resembles Hapi — mainly just through the jewelry that they both wear and their darker skin tones. A shared ability to summon demonic beasts is a much more concrete connection between the two. I hesitate to invest too much stock in even that, though, because Leda's summoning ability could be derived from the guitar she plays, not from her specific presence.

            <p>Claude is actually someone that Leda resembles more strongly. Her green eyes stand out quite a lot. Leda's clothing as a child is also more consistent with the clothing we have seen outside of mainland Fódlan. That doesn't necessarily mean she's Almyran, however. In fact, she may be from a nation we haven't ever seen before — a very distant relative of someone, at best.</p>

            <h2>The Characters Out Of Sight</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Now, we could talk about Theodora, but there isn't really enough there. Her lack of a Crest gives us nothing to go off of. She comes from royalty, but it's very likely that her roots are from outside of Fódlan. It's much more worthwhile looking at a few of the supporting characters in the first trailer, some that you might not have even noticed. We may know nothing about them, but their resemblance to characters that we have seen before is significant enough.</p>

            <p>We can start off with the nun with a gun, as she actually appears as more than just a unit on the map. Fans feel pretty strongly about her being connected to Lysithea. It comes down to the uniquely ovicular shape of their eyes, a distinct feature that they both share.</p>

            <p>The other two characters of note are practically hidden in the trailer, only appearing out of focus as playable units. Their hair colors almost perfectly match Linhardt and Annette, so these two characters are honestly major players in this overall theory. Is everyone in <i>Fortune's Weave</i> somehow related to the characters in <i>Three Houses</i>? Probably not, but a good amount of the new cast totally could be.</p>
