            <p><i>Borderlands 4</i> was announced on the first night of Gamescom, and it was a total surprise to my eyes seeing that fiery phoenix appear on my screen. Randy Pitchford had previously stated that the team had been working on the fourth 
              installment while work started on the <i>Borderlands</i> movie, and now it is official. So what have we learned? Well, let's get into that.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>What A Tease — Scrambling For Clues</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>It may have just been a teaser, but there are plenty of tidbits and clues that can be honed in on within the 
              trailer. To give you an example, a foreboding, tense beat follows the action, leading to the psycho mask being picked up by
              an arm of a Guardian of the Vault. Some are saying that the arm we see in the trailer belongs to The 
              Watcher from <i>Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel</i>. Part of the mystery too comes via the brief flash of a 
              message in the Eridian language. Thanks to the YouTube user, Skarrow9, we know the text at the 
              end says, “He is watching. Break Free.” Randy Pitchford on X has already shot down the possibility of Handsome Jack being related to any of this; that had also become a very popular speculation piece. I 
              am sure that in a week or two, all clues will have been found. Hopefully, we'll learn more about 
              the game's setting and its story direction.</p>

            </div>

            <br>
            <h2>Anything Else About <i>Borderlands 4</i>?</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>Unfortunately, no. Until the Pax West presentation on August 30th, there is nothing else to look into.
              However, based off their previous installments, we can (cautiously) start to get psyched up about the game. Each new 
              addition to the series has brought better developed vault hunters, crazier guns, new endgame systems
              to build your character further, better customization for vehicles and vault hunters — I could go on and on. 'Definitive' is the word being used in marketing so far so that hopefully means
              that the Gearbox team is confident in their ability to create the best looter-shooter game that we all know 
              they can.</p>

            <p><i>Borderlands 4</i> will tentatively release in 2025 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Epic Games Store, and Steam.</p>
