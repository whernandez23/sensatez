            <p><i>Pokémon TCG Pocket</i> is now in the full swing of things, and that means everyone is trying to get all the new, shiny, rare cards. More competitively minded players, though, may want to focus their attention on building towards a specific deck. That inherently means focusing on specific cards to pull for. 
            </p>

            <p>In <i>Pokémon TCG Pocket</i>, every card is most certainly not made equally. This holds true for the EX cards as well, which tend to be the backbone of any viable deck. If you're curious about what EX cards are best to build around, this is the right guide for you. So, let's take a look at the five best EX cards in this
               early Genetic Apex meta.</p>

            <h2>Moltres EX — A Fire Deck Staple</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>Energy generation is one of the most valuable effects in <i>Pokémon TCG Pocket</i>. Acquiring mass amounts of energy in the early-game provides an easy path to a win. Moltres EX is the Fire-type's sole energy generator, which makes it a necessity for almost any Fire-based deck. But even ignoring that fact, Moltres EX also happens to be the second best energy generator in the game.</p> 

            <p>Moltres' Inferno Dance costs just 1 energy with the potential to produce up to 3 energy that can be allocated in any which way that you want. Other energy generators like Lilligant and Gardevoir can only produce 1 extra energy for their respective types. Moltres EX also has the advantage of being a Basic Pokémon. The card can be played even on the very first turn. Its 140 HP gives you ample time
               to amass insane levels of energy advantage.
            </p>

            <p>Moltres EX will undoubtedly retain its value for quite a while. The card is a master of providing consistency, even if its energy output is entirely dependent on good RNG. A total oxymoron, I know, but that's just how <i>Pokémon TCG Pocket</i> works.
            </p>

               <img src="images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-ex-cards-november_moltresex.jpg" width="100%" class="center" alt="Moltres EX is the second best energy generator in the game, only behind Misty. Moltres is a must in Fire-type decks">
            </div>

            <br>
            <h2>Venusaur EX — Venusaur Brings The Bloom</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>Venusaur EX is, by far, the best Stage 2 EX card in the game. Having to evolve twice just isn't great for consistency's sake, but Venusaur can get away with it. What makes Venusaur stand out is honestly the Grass-type's impressive survivability. Erika healing 50 HP is nothing to scoff at. You can afford to have Bulbasaur and Ivysaur take hits most of the time. Venusaur EX also has access to an energy producer in the form of Lilligant. You can build up a threat real quick.</p>

            <p>Giant Bloom puts immense pressure on opponents, delivering a solid 100 damage and restoring 30 HP, making Venusaur feel like an unbreakable wall. If your opponent is lacking in energy, taking down Venusaur EX might be too tall of an order for them. Chipping away at Venusaur EX' health is not a viable winning strategy.</p>

            <p></p>

            </div>

            <br>
            <h2>Mewtwo EX — No Mind Games Needed, Just Pure Power</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>Mewtwo EX is what Charizard EX wishes it could be. Mewtwo is just a lot more reliable. The strategy behind Mewtwo EX is incredibly simple. Gardevoir needs to be out on the bench feeding Mewtwo energy. That's basically all the setup that is needed. Once Mewtwo gets to 4 energy, you just obliterate the opponent.</p>

            <hr class="rread-hr" id="rread-bothr">

            <p>Being a Basic Pokémon, of course, helps a lot. You don't need to rely on card draw after putting Mewtwo EX down on the board. Gardevoir is also a dependable source of energy if you can get that out. If your opponent doesn't have an immediate counter to Mewtwo over the course of about 3 turns, you basically win the game. If your opponent does have a counter, though, you're kinda screwed. Mewtwo EX decks don't really have alternate win conditions once Mewtwo goes down.</p>

            </div>

            <br>
            <h2>Pikachu EX — Tiny But Mighty</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>Pikachu isn't normally a Pokémon that you would associate with being a powerhouse, but Pikachu EX is a total monster in <i>Pokémon TCG Pocket</i>. It's just so easy to get Pikachu EX up and running as a Basic Pokémon. Circle Circuit also comes really cheap, costing just 2 energy while being able to do up to 90 damage.</p> 

            <p>Pikachu EX also has the added benefit of being a direct counter to Water-types, the best type in the game. It can't quite OHKO the absolute best Water-type cards in the game, though. Not once they're fully built up, at least. Ideally, you never have to worry about what your opponent does, though, thanks to the immediate pressure that Pikachu EX provides. 
               Pikachu's cheap retreat cost also does come in handy if you ever need to momentarily pivot to a healthier Pokémon in the mid-game.
            </p>

            <h2>Starmie EX — Cheap Water Is The Best Water</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>Starmie EX makes it readily apparent that availability is the best ability in <i>Pokémon TCG Pocket</i>. Doing 150+ damage is nice and all, but that's not necessary in the slightest. Cost effective cards are just better all-around. 90 damage off of just 2 energy is amazing. In Water-based decks, especially, that 2 energy could be generated in just a single turn, thanks to Misty.</p> 

            <p>Starmie EX has a solid amount of health. It does good damage. It's cost effective. It has a great typing. It can retreat for free. This is just a fantastic EX card. Starmie EX may not be the most impactful EX card in the game, but it is absolutely the best EX card just off of its own merit. Starmie EX doesn't need any other cards to help it succeed.
            </p>

            <div>
               <img src="images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-ex-cards-november_starmieex.jpg" width="100%" class="center" alt="Starmie EX is the most complete EX card in TCG Pocket. It is completely self-reliant and incredibly strong at that">
            </div>

            <br>

            <p>The first set's meta is just starting, but these five EX cards will definitely hold their high ranking until new cards start rolling out. Decks built around these cards have been proven to work. The soft launch in New Zealand has made that more than clear. You don't have to take <i>Pokémon TCG Pocket</i> super seriously, but it doesn't hurt to play with any of these strong EX cards.
            </p>
