            <p>Invisible Woman's Malice skin in <i>Marvel Rivals</i> is really hard to not notice in the game. There is a lot about it that is distinctly <em>visible</em>. It has been a very popular purchase, with players proudly using it in their matches. In all likelihood, you'll see the skin in just about every other game you queue into right now. People love it <em>that</em> much.
            </p>

            <p>If you think that Susan Storm's Malice skin was designed purely for the sake of promiscuity, well, you would be wrong. Sort of. The costume is definitely meant to be an attention-grabber, but it isn't some type of obscene original creation. Malice is a real character in the comics, and she does like to show skin. Now, how does she parallel Mister Fantastic's The Maker costume? Well, let's explore the origins of this Malice skin to find that out.

            <h2>Malice, The Mistress Of Hate — Sue Storm But Evil</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Malice is an evil version of Susan Storm, but she actually isn't from some alternate universe or anything like that. <strong>Malice is <em>the</em> Susan Storm from Earth-616, the original Marvel continuity</strong>. That's not generally standard for evil counterparts, so she actually has The Maker beat in that regard. That's the parallel between the two skins, by the way. They're both evil interpretations of their character.</p>

            <hr class="rread-hr" id="rread-bothr">

            <p>Malice, the Mistress of Hate, debuted in John Byrne's <i>Fantastic Four #280</i>. Effectively, Susan ends up getting brainwashed, thanks to the villainous Psycho-Man and his android, Hate-Monger. As Malice, all the dark things in Sue's heart get magnified and come to the forefront. She is just about everything that Sue would hate to normally be.</p>

            <p>Malice is very much not against using force. She uses Invisible Woman's powers to dangerous effect, attacking her own Fantastic Four teammates. Malice is proof that a sinister Susan Storm would be absolutely terrifying to fight. Her own team had no way of defeating her in a direct confrontation.</p>

            <h2>Malice's Relevance In The Comics — A Thorn In Sue's Side</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">Thankfully, Susan's time as Malice doesn't last for very long. Her real personality finally comes back to the surface when her husband, Reed, verbally abuses her with misogynistic words. Yeah, it's...quite the subplot. The Malice persona would lay dormant inside of Sue for a good while after until Sue's two personalities finally merged.
            </p>

            <p>From then on, Sue would be a lot less reserved. By all means, she remained a good person, but she was definitely angrier...and bolder. Her choice of outfit after the personality merger is interesting, to say the least. Honestly, it's probably too indecent, even for <i>Marvel Rivals</i>.</p>

            <p>Sue would finally get rid of the Malice persona for good with the help of her son from an alternate future, Psi-Lord. To summarize things very quickly, Malice was transferred onto an evil alternate reality version of Reed Richards, going by the name of Dark Raider. He was then presumably killed after falling into the Annihilation Barrier of the Negative Zone, so Malice is no more.</p>

            <h2>Malice's Design In Marvel Rivals — Creative Liberties Taken</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Marvel Rivals</i> loves redesigning old looks. A lot of dated costumes have been changed completely to fit the aesthetics of the game better. When it comes to Invisible Woman's Malice costume, added detail was definitely a big focus. The design of the costume definitely looks more complex in <i>Rivals</i>. At the very least, it is more than just a provocative dominatrix outfit. It feels more <em>dark</em> and <em>evil</em> in essence.</p> 

            <p>Swapping the cape out for a scarf, though, was definitely a peculiar choice. There's no doubt that they wanted to spotlight a few of Susan's features, both in the front and in the back. It's the most shameless skin in the game right now, but that throne can easily be claimed down the line.</p>
