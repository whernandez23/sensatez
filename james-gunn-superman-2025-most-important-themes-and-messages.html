            <p>James Gunn's upcoming <i>Superman (2025)</i> has been tasked with quite the heavy burden. The future of DC Studios depends almost entirely on the success of the film. And to actually come out to critical acclaim, Gunn's <i>Superman</i> needs to be more than just a comic book movie. It needs to be a reminder to moviegoers that these films can be a profound form of art. 
               Based on what Gunn has said recently, it seems that everyone behind the movie understands that well. 
            </p>

            <p>Gunn's <i>Superman</i> is a movie with purpose. It's not just some sloppy, brainless, action film. Sure, this is going to be a pivotal start to a grander DCU, but <i>Superman</i> is much more than just the standard superhero story. Thematically, perhaps it isn't super complex, but it has some important messages to deliver. Plus, this version of Superman is likely going to be the most vulnerable Superman we have ever seen on the big screen. There is a lot of promise in this project.</p>

            <h2>A Beaten Down Superman — Inherent Goodness Challenged</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">In a Q&A following a press preview of the <i>Superman</i> trailer, James Gunn likened Superman to the state of the United States of America. Superman is battered — at the edge of collapse. But even at the brink of ruin, hope still remains. <i>Superman (2025)</i> is all about goodness. That is something inherent to human beings, even if that doesn't seem to be the case at times.</p> 

            <p>Almost everyone wants to be good. But when other more sinister voices come into play, that's when the infighting starts. But at our very core, we humans want to be kind. That's what Superman represents. That's what Superman fights for. Even as an alien from an entirely different planet, Superman represents the best of us on Earth. He truly believes in the innate goodness of humanity, even if acceptance isn't
               afforded to him.
            </p>

            <p>Aliens not being accepted...I wonder how that has come up as a big talking point in recent times...In earnest, Superman has always had the potential to be a complex character. He has always been the symbol of hope, but, in the films, Superman has never really felt relatable. James Gunn plans on changing that. It's a smart direction to take the character in.</p>

            <h2>How Superman Will Be Tested</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">The <i>Superman</i> trailer showed off quite a lot. And yet, there were no clear plot lines covered. What's the movie about? Who knows. Lex Luthor is probably the main antagonist, but even that's not exactly a confirmed fact. What we do know is that Lex will challenge Superman's goodness. How they play off of each other is going to be a very important part of the film.
            </p>

            <p>The same will be true if Ultraman is, in fact, a part of this movie. There's probably no better way to directly contrast Superman's kindness than with a look-alike that runs off of pure hatred and malice. The dynamic between the two characters could really make for an interesting narrative. There's so much potential there.</p>
