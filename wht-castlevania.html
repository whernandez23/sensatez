            <p>If you look up the origins behind the <i>Castlevania</i> franchise, you're going to be surprised at just how little conclusive information is out there. While Shigeru Miyamoto has just about shared every source of inspiration for
               Mario, the original director of the first <i>Castlevania</i> game has laid low since his last work with the franchise. Just a few years ago, we didn't even really know who the creator of the franchise was. Konami has been strangely silent
               about the franchise as a whole and I suppose that's why we're here in the present-day without a new <i>Castlevania</i> game since 2014. Here we're going to cover the different eras of the franchise to hopefully answer what exactly happened to <i>Castlevania</i>.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>The Original Trilogy</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Nowadays, we can say fairly certainly that the mind behind <i>Castlevania</i> is Hitoshi Akamatsu. A lover of Western movies, Akamatsu's primary concern with the first <i>Castlevania</i> was making it feel cinematic. He wanted players to feel like they were 
               in a horror movie with the visuals and sound design reinforcing that concept. Although Akamatsu wasn't a particularly great decision-maker, most of his design choices were very intentional. Simon Belmont controls in a very specific manner in order to 
               feel like a natural extension of the player's inputs. The timing of his actions were meticulously designed to feel perfect. And yes, if you're curious, Simon's whip <i>is</i> a reference to <i>Indiana Jones</i>. In regards to the subweapons, Akamatsu 
               recognized that they all carried their own unique utility but that some were clearly stronger than others. That is why the player gets introduced to them in a specific order. The knife demonstrates that subweapons exist and offer different
               abilities than the whip. Then, you encounter the stopwatch which allows you to stop time and experiment with attacking enemies. And eventually, you'll find the cross which is one of the best offensive tools in the game. Almost everything has an
               intended purpose to create a better experience.
            </p>

            <p>An instant classic, Konami didn't need to think too hard about whether or not <i>Castlevania (1986)</i> merited a sequel. A year later, <i>Castlevania II: Simon's Quest</i> would release and that game would try to innovate with a non-linear format akin to
               Nintendo's <i>Metroid</i>. At least, that's what most people tend to say; Akamatsu would disagree, referencing <i>The Maze of Galious</i> as a greater source of inspiration for the game's exploration. It is certainly an atypical NES game with the amount of
               backtracking needed (though, I suppose most NES games at that time needed a guide to beat anyway). It was arguably ahead of its time and it wouldn't be until later generations of consoles that the concept would be better realized within the <i>Castlevania</i>
               franchise (i.e. <i>Symphony of the Night</i>). <i>Castlevania: The Adventure</i> is technically the next mainline game, but it doesn't seem to have any input from Hitoshi Akamatsu so we'll skip it. Do take note, however, of Konami's interest in handhelds as 
               they'll make a nice home for the series later. <i>Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</i> is the final game in the series that Akamatsu would direct, the game serving as a prequel to the last two entries.

            <h2>Port Town I</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Because this is strictly a simpler track compared to Port Town II, there isn't too much to say. Directly after the left-pull and right-pull magnets, there's a long straightaway before the turn that takes you to the finish line. Compared 
               to Port Town II, this means that you have more room to abuse your boosts without needing to be concerned about lacking health late into a lap or crashing into a chicane. The best place to use the Skyway as a result is undoubtedly right before
               the magnets when you're behind. If you're close to the front of the pack, then you might actually gain more by skipping the annoying turns near the beginning of the race. As long as you can manage your boosts well, you should be able to
               regularly finish at the top of the list. If you have the sufficient confidence, nothing about this track should scare you.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Red Canyon I</h2>
            <br>
            <p>If you're not that great at drifting, then Red Canyon I is going to force you to learn. There are some very sharp turns that require you to slow down in order to drift through them properly. In one section, there's even a turn 
               directly after another turn. Boosting is ill-advised for most sections of this track as you'll end up colliding into a lot of walls if you just do it all willy-nilly. The start and the end of the track are the only realistic places
               to boost without endangering yourself. You can't stress yourself out too much on this track or you're going to make poor decisions. Concern yourself primarily with executing every turn properly. There's a lot of room to make up lost ground.
               If you're comfortable with the track, you can shave off a lot of seconds on the average lap compared to other racers. The Skyway has utility just about anywhere here. My general advice is to save it for your weakest section when possible,
               but it is a good time save just about anywhere on Red Canyon I.

            <h2>White Land II</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The final race of the Queen League Grand Prix will see you race on this track. Compared to Silence, I actually think this track will generally be easier for most racers. There are a couple of hairpins back-to-back, but everything else is
               fairly manageable. For those unfamiliar with the course, the hairpins can be quite the time waster as the natural instinct is to avoid any collisions and slowly make the turn. As you can see in the image below, though, you can actually
               drive through the barriers in between. The fastest way to get through this section is to slow down right before the first hairpin and then cutting right through the middle barrier. You should be at a good speed to 
               do the exact same thing with the next hairpin but even more smoothly. You can also boost right after this section fairly comfortably, leaving other struggling racers in the dust. Bumper cars are going to be your worst nightmare on this track 
               so just be vigilant that you're not putting yourself in a position to have your entire race ruined by one of them even if it means playing more safely in the more dangerous sections of the course.
            </p>

            <h2>Death Wind II</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The new Pro Tracks addition, Death Wind II, is the least forgiving track of this bunch. The first time you race on it, you're probably going to suck real bad. While Death Wind I is just a longer version of Baby Park from the <i>Mario Kart</i> series,
               Death Wind II is more reminiscent of something from the deepest pits of hell. Okay, that's definitely an exaggeration, but it'll feel that way when one bad turn leaves you pinballing off the guardrails several times. Getting every dash zone is necessary
               for a good finish and the best way to hit them is by slowing down a little and strafing towards them as you approach one. You have to account for the wind so strafing will have you hit them more frequently even if it's not an action you're used to doing. 
               Slowing down a little will mainly just stop you from careening off the walls if you don't hit the right angle. This is a great place to use the Skyway as there's nothing more consistent than just skipping it altogether. Save the ordinary boosts for the straightaways as having 98 other racers trying to make the same turns as you in this section is more than enough chaos already.
               In summary, hit every dash zone possible and just hope your opponents mess up more than you. If you're keeping your machine healthy, then you're already doing a better job than most. That's all for now. See you when the King League comes out soon!
