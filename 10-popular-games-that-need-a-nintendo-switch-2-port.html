            <br> 
            <p>The <strong style="color: #ff2945;"><i>Nintendo Switch 2</i></strong> is a very capable piece of hardware. Being able to handle a <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> port is no small feat, and giving a comparable experience to the Xbox Series S version of the game is something that should be heavily lauded. With <i>Cyberpunk</i> serving as a strong precedent, greater support for Nintendo's new console can — and should — be expected.

            <p>Despite what some may think, Nintendo maintains a good working relationship with most developers in the industry. While it's true that Nintendo systems haven't been a popular destination for AAA-quality games, that has always had more to do with the sheer lack of hardware power. The Nintendo Switch 2 still won't be competing with the PS5 or Xbox Series X in that regard, but just being close enough will go a long way in bringing in more third-party titles.</p>

            <h2>Resident Evil 4 Remake</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Capcom has already demonstrated a strong desire to work on the Nintendo Switch 2, with <i>Street Fighter 6</i> having been one of the system's launch titles. That port is fairly impressive, too, putting up a good showing when compared to the other consoles. The RE Engine seems to take great advantage of DLSS, which is ironic considering that DLSS isn't even an option available on the PC versions of most modern Capcom games. This is great news for a potential <i>Resident Evil 4 Remake</i> port, as it shouldn't be any more challenging to optimize than <i>Street Fighter 6</i>.
            </p>

            <p>In all likelihood, a <i>Resident Evil 4 Remake</i> port on the Switch 2 would need to upscale from a lower native resolution. Capcom has already shown that such a technique can deliver great results with their <i>Street Fighter 6</i> port, but <i>Resident Evil</i> may present a different hurdle altogether due to its heavier reliance on 3D motions. Even so, the Switch 2 could be a more than adequate platform to play <i>RE4R</i> on with some slight visual tweaking. Mouse controls would also be a nice add for improved aiming. All in all, <i>Resident Evil 4</i> just simply belongs on a Nintendo console.</p>

            <h2>Valorant</h2>  

            <p class="arh2-spc">When it comes to popular online multiplayer experiences, Nintendo is pretty far behind. <i>Valorant</i> would be a good place to start for the Switch 2, as it has both massive appeal and not-too-demanding system requirements. The Nintendo Switch 2 could achieve a legitimately good visual fidelity while also boasting a frame rate of 120fps. This is actually a rarity on the Switch 2, at the moment. Games aren't taking advantage of the console's 120hz support. What would be better to set the tone than a game like <i>Valorant</i>? And again, I'll repeat this a lot, mouse controls could make a world of a difference for players. There's a future where <i>Valorant</i> on the Switch 2 is actually the best console version.

            <h2>Tekken 8</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">The Nintendo Switch 2 could be a great platform for fighting games, and <i>Tekken 8</i> is absolutely a title that could make its way there. Bandai Namco and Nintendo have a great partnership going, so a port of the latest <i>Tekken</i> game just feels like a given. Maybe a special edition won't be possible this time around, like what the Wii U got with <i>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</i>, but just the game alone would suffice. 
            </p>

            <p>Tekken 8 is a gorgeous-looking game. The character models, in particular, are impeccable. It would be interesting to see if a Switch 2 version of the game would be able to retain most of that beauty. Sacrifices would definitely need to be made to get the game running at a consistent 60fps, though, so it would be understandable if performance is ultimately prioritized. Who knows what some proper optimization could do for a port, though.</p>

            <h2>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Here's the first game that might actually be too taxing for the Nintendo Switch 2. <i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i> is one of 2025's greatest releases and deserves to be played by as many people as possible. The Switch 2 is an ideal machine for RPGs, its portability making it perfect for games that need a lot of your time. The two definitely need to come together. That being said, <i>Expedition 33</i> isn't exacty light on hardware. The game has some magnificent sights...that come at a steep cost when it comes to performance.
            </p>

            <p><i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i> is available on the Xbox Series S, so a port to the Switch 2 is theoretically possible. A 30fps cap on the Series S does make the prospects of that a bit dubious, though. Even so, <i>Expedition 33</i> is exactly the kind of game that should be on Nintendo's new system. A premier gaming experience that would have never been able to run on the old Switch. Nintendo has things to prove, and <i>Expedition 33</i> would do well with the system's audience.</p>

            <h2>Rematch</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Nintendo loves cooperative experiences, and <i>Rematch</i> is one of the biggest ones of this year. The multiplayer soccer game is vibrant and fantastic with friends, perfectly suited for a Nintendo console. A potential Switch 2 version probably wouldn't look too glamorous, but that would be a more than valid trade-off for getting the gameplay on the system. Considering the lack of <i>Mario</i> sports games at the moment, <i>Rematch</i> would also fill a mostly empty niche. EA has some of their sports games on the Switch 2, but their games don't exactly feel all that special anymore.

            <h2>Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Continuing the plea for RPGs, <i>Metaphor: ReFantazio</i> is another game in the genre that would do excellently on the Switch 2. Atlus has always had great confidence in Nintendo as a home for their games, but the original Switch had its limitations. The Switch 2, on the other hand, should be able to handle <i>ReFantazio</i> no problem. Again, it's an ideal system for that kind of game. It <i>should</i> be easy to pick up and play. You need ease of access, especially in a lengthy adventure like <i>Metaphor: ReFantazio</i> where you can distract yourself with all kinds of sidequests and dungeon visits. It wouldn't be surprising to see <i>Persona 3 Reload</i> eventually make its way to the Switch 2 either.

            <h2>Genshin Impact</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">While I'm choosing to mention <i>Genshin Impact</i> first and foremost, all the HoYoverse games are good candidates for a potential port to the Nintendo Switch 2. <i>Genshin Impact</i> is simply the one game that was actually supposed to receive a Nintendo Switch release. That never happened, presumably for performance reasons. The Switch 2 would be a good time to remedy that. Considering that Nintendo doesn't really offer too many free-to-play experiences, it would be a good environment for HoYoverse to get into. Less competition means more money for them. Of course, the games would also probably look pretty enticing, too, even just on a visual level.

            <h2>Stellar Blade</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Stellar Blade</i>'s director gifted his team a bunch of Switch 2s, so I'm sure they wouldn't mind seeing their crown jewel on the system. The logistics of that are a little hazy, though. <i>Stellar Blade</i> is an Unreal Engine 4 game, which is a plus for optimization, but it still is a pretty demanding title on handheld systems like the Steam Deck. <i>Stellar Blade</i> is the kind of game that you would like to have at 60fps, so a good amount of work would need to go into refining the game for a Switch 2 port. The graphics still need to be pretty good, though, so that players can appreciate a few particular assets in the game. It's part of the appeal. It's important.

            <h2>Lies Of P</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">A few FromSoftware Soulslike games will eventually make their way to the Switch 2 over the next year, but that doesn't mean that <i>Lies of P</i> can't end up on the system. <i>Lies of P</i> would actually make for a great demonstration of the Nintendo Switch 2's power, as not too much visual fidelity would need to be sacrificed to get the game ported to the console. In theory, it could end up looking fairly similar to the Xbox Series S version of the game, which is pretty good. A Switch 2 version would also likely include the high frame rate mode present on the other consoles. That would also go a long way in combining beautiful visuals with solid performance.

            <h2>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">Last but not least, it's absolutely worth mentioning <i>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</i>. We sort of already know that it will eventually be coming to the system, but we don't technically know that for sure. Either way, Square Enix is going to need to put a lot of effort into optimizing the game for the Switch 2, because even the ROG Ally X doesn't run the game all that well. A Switch 2 version outputting the game at 720p30fps when docked is not something anyone would want to see. It's hard to say anything about this until we see what <i>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</i> looks like on the console. Just the concept of <i>Rebirth</i> coming out on the Nintendo Switch 2 is pretty exciting, though.
