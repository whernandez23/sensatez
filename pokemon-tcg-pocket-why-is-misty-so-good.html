            </div>
            <br> 
            <p>If you've been playing against competitive decks in <i>Pokémon TCG Pocket</i>, you've probably noticed that Misty's a staple of almost every single Water-based deck out there. Misty is widely considered one of the best cards in the game, but what exactly makes her so good? Well, the answer is pretty simple. At her best, Misty absolutely breaks the game.
            </p>

            <h2>Misty Provides Energy Like Nothing Else In The Game</h2>
            <br>

            <p>Now, it might seem odd for a card dependent on coin flipping to be so good, but that just goes to show how much advantage Misty is able to offer. Even gaining just 1 energy off her makes her more than worth it to advance your strategies. Starmie EX, Articuno EX, Blastoise EX — nearly any Water-type card can massively benefit from Misty. A lot of Water-type cards are energy hungry, so it's just to great to have a card that can build up either your Active Pokémon or a Pokémon on your bench.</p> 

            <p>Misty also just happens to be fairly unique in the sense that there is no limit to her powers. With a lot of luck, you could end up attaching 7 Water energy to your Blastoise ex just by using her with absolutely zero downsides. Really, there's no reason <em>not</em> to use Misty, unless energy isn't that important to your Water deck.
            </p>

               <img src="images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-why-is-misty-so-good_mistycoinflip.jpg" width="100%" class="center" alt="Coin flipping with Misty can lead to absurd levels of energy advantage. An overload of Water energy can secure a game in just a few turns">
            </div>

            <br>
            <h2>The Potential For First Turn Kills</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>One thing that Misty exclusively enables is first turn kills. When you start a match and you go first, you normally don't have access to any energy. Misty, however, allows you to get energy even on the very first turn. Combine that with some very strong Basic Water-type ex cards that are instantly playable and you can make the game unwinnable for your opponent. 
            </p>

            <p>If your opponent doesn't have any bench Pokémon on the first turn, you can also just straight up win by KO'ing their active Pokémon. It's a win by technicality, but that's still a win. An incredibly lame way to lose, sure, but it's in the game.</p>

            <hr class="rread-hr" id="rread-bothr">

            <p>It's best to just assume that Misty's dominance will continue. A ban list doesn't seem to be coming in the foreseeable future, so there's no stopping the popularity of this card. She's also not quite <em>that</em> broken to deserve being banned, but the general opinion on that could change over time.
            </p>

            <p>What can be said for sure, though, is that Misty will remain a powerful option even after new sets drop. She has set a high bar for what decks can do, and it's unlikely that decks will be able to counter her anytime soon.</p>
