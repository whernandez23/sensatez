            <p>The inevitable bikini update is finally making its way to <i>Tekken 8</i> and it will be available after the release of the v1.06 update on <b>July 23rd</b>. Players can look forward to having their favorite characters match with the new, free, summer-themed stage, Seaside Resort, which will be released at the same time. And, of course, it's not just bikinis. You'll also be able to have the likes of Eddy or Jin in swim trunks, if you so desire.

            <h2>New Beach Outfit Descriptions</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>Let's start with describing the men's beachwear because it's pretty basic. The most outstanding aspect of the men's outfit is the Hawaiian-styled swim trunks. The floral theme is actually consistent for both the men and women. The men wear a really simple top, though, that is just an unbuttoned, casual, dress shirt. No Hawaiian shirts here. To complete the look are some fairly standard-looking sandals; well, maybe toe loops aren't actually all that standard...
            </p>

            <p>The women wear a bikini (not unexpected), but they also have a sarong on. If you don't know what that is, I'm not sure I really do either but it's a beach wrap that goes around the waist. I will say, it does add nice depth to what would be a very basic outfit otherwise. You can just look at one of Azucena's outfits to see how simple they could've gotten. The hibiscus design present on all of the outfit also adds some personality. Closing the look out are some flat thong sandals.
               Maybe that's an accurate description? I <i>hope</i> so. Let's just move on.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Pricing Logistics For The New Skins</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>Will these outfits be free? Unfortunately, no. That's just 
              good business from the <i>Tekken</i> team; they know this will sell well. More likely than not, these outfits will follow the same pricing model as the previous releases on the Tekken Shop — a price of 400 Tekken Coins and separate purchases required to obtain both the men's and women's outfits.

            <p>Something that might make things more convenient for players is the new ability to purchase "300 Tekken Coins" within the Tekken Shop instead of only being
              able to purchase in intervals of 500. Ergo, you'll be able to acquire both packs without having unnecessary Tekken Coins left over. Or, if you just want one outfit pack, you can purchase 300 Tekken Coins and get the remaining 100 needed for the fee through the Free Tier of the upcoming Tekken Fight Pass — Round 2. This still isn't a perfect system for the consumer, but it's progress.

            <p><i>Tekken 8</i> fans, the wait won't be too long now. There's honestly a lot to look forward to in this update so it's a great time to come back if you've been taking a break from the game. Whether it's for the bikinis or the gameplay, it's your prerogative. And if you don't have the game, well, there's great deals available. I'll always recommend CDKeys and you can get the <a href="https://www.cdkeys.com/pc/tekken-8-pc-steam" target="_blank">PC version of the game</a> for up to
              50% off on the site. Might as well save something if you're looking to also buy cosmetics. Enjoy the summer update and don't let the heat get to you too much.
            </p>
