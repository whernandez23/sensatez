            </div>
            <br> 
            <p><i>Zenless Zone Zero</i> has struck the hearts of many, and it's only going to get better with the release of Version 1.4. As tends to happen with any major miHoYo project, <i>ZZZ</i> leaks have just about spoiled everything that will soon be coming. That may ruin all the fun that comes with announcements and trailers, but, hey, now we know that there's <em>even more</em> to be excited about than usual.
            </p>

            <p>In terms of an expected release date for <i>Zenless Zone Zero</i>'s Version 1.4, <strong>the third week of December 2024 seems to be a very likely release window</strong>. The <i>ZZZ</i> team is going to close out the year strong, effectively giving the game a soft relaunch as we head into 2025. A lot of new content and changes are coming.</p>

            <h2>Zenless Zone Zero Soon To Release On Xbox?</h2>
            

            <p class="arh2-spc">Before we even talk about any in-game updates, though, it's worth mentioning that <i>Zenless Zone Zero</i> is expected to release on Xbox at some point during Version 1.4. In August, it was confirmed that <i>Genshin Impact</i> would be making the move to Xbox. With a working partnership already in place, it makes sense that <i>Zenless Zone Zero</i> will now also find itself on Xbox systems.
               No specific release date or anything like that is known just yet. This is about as raw as rumors get, but it's plenty believable.</p>

            <h2>Harumasa and Miyabi, The Two New Big Banner Features</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">It really isn't too much of a surprise that Harumasa and Miyabi will soon become playable. They were going to get their turn eventually. Both Harumasa and Miyabi appear relatively early on in the story, so many players will recognize them both as being members of Hollow Special Operations Section 6 (or just, Section 6 for short).</p>

            <p><strong>Version 1.4 will feature two separate banners: one with Harumasa and the other with Miyabi</strong>. It appears that the two banners will run concurrently. Furthermore, the banners are expected to last for the
              full duration of the patch. It doesn't seem like things will be broken down into phases.</p>

            <p>Harumasa is an Electric Attack character. He uses his bow for both projectile and melee attacks. His bow doubles as a pair of blades, which is what allows him to switch up his combat style. Harumasa's moves have some excellent animations to them, flashy in all the ways that you'd want them to be. His gameplay loop is a bit too complicated to fully explain in words, but you basically want to mark
               enemies with arrows to put Harumasa in a position to do more damage.
            </p>

            <p>Miyabi is an Ice Anomaly character. Despite that, her kit is something you'd expect more out of an Attack character than an Anomaly one. Miyabi is a Crit-based damaged dealer, through and through. The only reason she isn't an Attack character is probably so that she doesn't benefit from Ellen's W-Engine. Otherwise, her output would be unfathomably broken. But even without that, Miyabi looks insane. She is definitely going to be an attractive character to pull for.</p>

            <p>Last thing of note, every <i>ZZZ</i> player will apparently be able to get a free Harumasa. We'll see if that ends up being true. It's not exactly hard to believe. It would just be really nice.</p>

            <h2>Miscellaneous Gameplay Changes And Additions</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Zenless Zone Zero</i> is going to look pretty different after Version 1.4's release. The most important change will come to the game's decibel system. Or rather, what's going to change is that <strong>every character in a team will have their own individual Decibel Rating</strong>. Gone will be the days of having your characters build up collectively towards an Ultimate attack. Now, every character has no choice but to be self-reliant. A good amount of characters could care less
               about this change, but this will come as a tough nerf to a few names.</p>
            
            <p>Speaking of the characters themselves, Version 1.4 will add more ways to actively interact with all the characters you've acquired. Most notably, <strong>you'll be able to walk through the overworld with any of the characters you own after the Version 1.4 update</strong>.</p>

            <p><i>Zenless Zone Zero</i> will also get a dating mode. Okay, well, not really, but players will be able to do more with characters after getting them to a Trust level of 4. Mainly, you'll be able to take them out on different trips. The potential locations apparently depend on each individual character. More details on that are definitely needed, but it's nice to see the Trust mechanics getting further developed.</p>

            <p>The last big change will be coming to the game's early story chapters. Apparently, they're going to be re-designed. How different they'll look afterwards is unknown for the moment. Presumably, though, the <i>ZZZ</i> team wants players to be more engaged with the early story. They could accomplish that in a variety of different ways.</p>

            </div>

            <br>

            <p>There is no doubt going to be even more added into <i>Zenless Zone Zero</i> with Version 1.4 than what has been mentioned here. Leakers know how to get information out, but they can't exactly leak <em>everything</em>. A couple of surprises won't hurt anyway.
            </p>

            <p>A fun, new era of <i>Zenless Zone Zero</i> is quickly approaching. If there has ever been a time to come back to the game, it will be definitely be right after the Version 1.4 update.</p>
