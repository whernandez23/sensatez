            <p>Competing with the titan that is <i>Overwatch</i> isn't for everyone, but <i>Marvel Rivals</i> doesn't seem to be any bit scared by the genre overlap. And with the incorporation of the strong IP that is <i>Marvel</i>, perhaps NetEase's confidence is well-founded. <i>Marvel Rivals'</i> gameplay may not be entirely original, but the game exudes its own unique 
               personality, making it feel very much like its own distinct experience. The closed alpha test doesn't exactly give us the full picture, but it does provide just enough to affirm that strong sense of identity. And I have to say, <i>Marvel Rivals</i> may still just be in the alpha stage, but it feels like a game that knows what it wants to do and that actually
               executes on its vision.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Examining the Gameplay & First Impressions of the Characters</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>Again, I will say that <i>Marvel Rivals</i> isn't exactly doing anything innovative. The third-person perspective changes the dynamic of things just a tiny little bit, but ultimately <i>Rivals</i> doesn't play all that different from <i>Overwatch 2</i> or <i>Paladins</i>, for that matter. The familiar gameplay isn't exactly a negative, though. If you're coming
               from one of those aforementioned games, then your skills will carry over seamlessly. And at its core, fighting for objectives is just plain fun. There's a reason why <i>Overwatch</i> blew up...and no, I'm pretty sure it doesn't have anything to do with the portrayal of some characters. 
            </p>

            <p>But on the topic of characters, the roster is absolutely where <i>Marvel Rivals</i> comes to life. Even in terms of graphics, there's a lot to be impressed by. Effectively every single character has something unique to them gameplay-wise and there is <i>a lot</i> of respect for the IP even if it throws standard game balance out the window. Iron Man isn't hampered by some arbitrary fuel system; he can fly forever and so can Storm. Doctor Strange 
               can set up a portal that can effectively connect any two points on the map. Scarlet Witch has an ult that OHKOs all enemies within her range. Things get ridiculous; and yet, the game doesn't feel fundamentally broken because of any single character. Just about anyone on the roster can deal with everyone else in a 1v1 and that's fairly impressive. <i>Rivals</i> is designed
               to allow creativity to flourish and it creates an environment where superheroes can actually feel <b>super</b>.</p>

            <p>Believe me, though, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. As fun as things may be in casual quick matches where coordination and strategy aren't the average player's specialty, competitive matches are a humbling grind. You're going to encounter absolute monsters that push their characters to their limits. You'll also start to hone in on all the little features that make every
               character annoying to play against. With enough support, some characters feel absolutely unkillable. Some will make you feel like you can't even play the game at times. The balancing situation isn't too dire, but I do think the developers need to reconsider how characters interact with each other. Some combinations simply shouldn't be as powerful as they currently are. Also, 
               as a random aside, they <b>really</b> need to change how damage indicators work. I just can't tell if I'm near full health or close to dying when the screen flashes the same red either way.
            </p>

            <br>  
            <h2>Diving Into The Other In-Game Features & What the Future Holds for Them</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I wish I could say that live-service games always had the players' best interests in mind, but you'd be hard-pressed to find any such examples. Free-to-play almost always comes at a cost to players whether they realize it or not. I can guarantee you that <i>Marvel Rivals</i> will have a battle pass. You can make a safe bet that the game will have skins that you can purchase.
               How will we be able to unlock new characters in the full game? Hopefully, not through some scummy paid model, but you never know. <i>Rivals</i> just doesn't appear like it will be any different from your average F2P game. There is nothing you can actually buy in the closed alpha test, though, so...hey, they could prove me wrong.
            </p>

            <p>Cosmetics aside, there isn't a whole lot more substance to <i>Marvel Rivals</i>. As much as the maps seem to lean into some kind of story, it doesn't appear that a PvE mode is in the game's plans at the moment. And the only other gamemode that is currently available and probable for inclusion in the full release is called Conquest which is basically a team deathmatch (first to 50 kills wins).
               From my experience, it doesn't even seem to be particularly popular as it regularly had long queue up times. Ideally, <i>Rivals</i> adds at least one other gamemode just to keep things fresh; otherwise, the game is going to be a bit content-starved.</p>

            </div>
               
            <br>
            <p><i>Marvel Rivals</i> has laid some great foundation for eventual success. It feels great. It looks great. It plays great. I'm not going to call it an <i>Overwatch</i> killer or anything like that, but I do think it brings back more legitimacy to the hero shooter genre as a formula for mass interest. There's a lot to be excited about, but some extra polishing is definitely needed. It's fun, but NetEase 
               needs to make sure that it <b>stays</b> fun weeks after release. And if they want a loyal fanbase through thick and thin, they better treat players with the utmost respect. We can easily see through lies these days — don't need the Eye of Agamotto for that.
