            <p><strong style="color: #ff2945;"><i>Mario Kart World</i></strong> is like nothing that the <i>Mario Kart</i> franchise has seen before. The trailer from the April 2nd Nintendo Direct was eye-opening on its own, but actual hands-on footage from Nintendo Treehouse: Live has left an even greater impression. The game looks gorgeous, yes, but it also has a lot of depth to it, as well. <i>Mario Kart World</i> is anything but a lazy sequel to <i>Mario Kart 8</i>. We're talking about a literal world of a difference between this new game and its predecessors.

            <h2><i>Mario Kart World</i> Introduces A Few New Features</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Two new mechanics immediately stand out in <i>Mario Kart World</i>: <strong>rail riding and wall riding</strong>. The inevitable comparisons to <i>Sonic</i> aside, the two new forms of riding both look fun and purposeful. Plenty of courses make use of the mechanic, favoring those who properly take advantage of them. Knowing exactly when to jump forward or to the side on various different courses is definitely something that'll take some practice. Because there's more airtime, <i>Mario Kart World</i> now lets you trick multiple times in the air. That's something to consider, as well.
            </p>

            <p>On the cosmetic side of things, <strong>costumes are now collectible in <i>Mario Kart World</i></strong>. You'll be able to select them from the character select screen, but a new item available on certain courses will also allow you to change your character's costume mid-race. Presumably, you'll have to find the unique costumes in the world before properly unlocking them. It's still to be seen, however, if very minor characters like Coin Coffer will actually get costumes of their own. We've not seen evidence of that being the case, so far.</p>

            <h2>Changes From <i>Mario Kart 8</i></h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Vehicles in <i>Mario Kart World</i> are no longer customizable. Selecting individual car parts isn't something that you can do anymore. There are still a lot of different preset designs to choose from, though. Every kart also now has watercraft and sleigh forms for additional forms of travel. Those two additions will partially compensate for <strong>the removal of anti-gravity mode</strong>. No more dramatic twists and turns. <i>Mario Kart World</i> is going in a very different direction.
            </p>

            <p><i>Mario Kart World</i>'s physics are noticeably different from past entries, especially when it comes to how collisions now work. Your character will now "rag doll" when you get hit. Momentum matters, as you can retain some of your speed depending on how exactly you were hit. The game mostly just looks a little more silly now, but maybe there's something deeper there.</p>

            <p>Another interesting change, albeit a bit small in nature, has to do with how items operate in <i>Mario Kart World</i>. Items will now automatically assume a defensive position behind your kart. You no longer need to hold the button down. This isn't exactly game-changing, but it's definitely something to account for.</p>

            <h2>The Interconnectivity Of The World</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Mario Kart World</i> actually feels like its own world. The game stresses that as much as possible. Even in the Grand Prix mode, you'll be racing to every single course, past the first one. The interconnectivity of the whole world really is impressive. The game feels like it offers scenic road trips as much as it offers races. Free Roam Mode has a built-in Photo Mode for good reason. Who wouldn't want to properly take in those sights while you aren't fighting for your life?

            <p>Knockout Tour is <i>Mario Kart World</i>'s newest game mode, and it highlights the depth of the world perfectly. It takes the concept of a Grand Prix to new heights. Knockout Tour is essentially a marathon race through 6 different courses. At every checkpoint, more and more racers will get eliminated until just 4 are left to race to the finish. There's no stopping whatsoever, by the way. That's how connected the world really is. You'll be driving non-stop until you make it to the finish line, assuming you don't get eliminated earlier.</p>

            <p><i>Mario Kart World</i> is well beyond the scope of what the original Nintendo Switch is capable of. All the footage available for the game makes that clear as day. <i>Mario Kart World</i> looks as fun as it looks beautiful, and this new entry will surely capture the hearts of many. Nintendo Treehouse: Live deserves much praise for sharing so much info with the public. Hopefully we can see more of them again in the future.</p>
