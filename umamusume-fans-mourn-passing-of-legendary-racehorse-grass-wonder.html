            <br> 
            <p>On August 8, 2025, Big Red Farm announced the passing of the legendary 30-year-old racehorse, Grass Wonder. His condition had sharply deteriorated the evening prior, and his death has since been attributed to multiple organ failure, the result of a natural decline in strength with his advancing age. Grass Wonder was the last notable surviving member of Japan's 1998 "Golden Generation" of racehorses. The passing of Grass Wonder closes the curtains to a legendary era of Japanese horse racing, one that will live on forever in the hearts of fans.

            <h2>A Brief History Of Grass Wonder</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Despite Grass Wonder's noteworthy career in Japanese horse racing, he was actually an American-bred Thoroughbred racehorse — foaled in Kentucky on February 18, 1995. Grass Wonder would eventually be sold a year later to Nobuo Tsunoda, prompting his move to Japan. In September of 1997, Grass Wonder made his official racing debut in a maiden race at Nakayama Racecourse, the first of many wins to his name.
            </p>

            <p>Grass Wonder was recognized as a special horse from early on. He was voted the best 2-year-old colt of 1997. He stood out early in a generation that would eventually gain fame for also producing Special Week, Seiun Sky, King Halo, and El Condor Pasa. Grass Wonder clearly had the natural drive and talent to win, which made him an easy favorite. Even when he was wildly out of form at the end of his 1998 season, Grass Wonder was selected to race in the Arima Kinen. Despite his lack of results during the rest of the year, he closed it out with a big win at the Grade 1 race.</p>

            <p>1999 was a standout year for Grass Wonder, marked by two Grade 1 titles alongside two Grade 2 wins. His close rivalry with Special Week also happened to be one of the biggest storylines of the year. While Special Week was — and still is — considered the superior horse of the two, their very first confrontation at the Takarazuka Kinen saw Grass Wonder taking the gold. Their rematch at the Arima Kinen later that year would be a race for the ages. By just a nose, Grass Wonder was able to eke out the win in a three-way photo finish. The Arima Kinen would be his last major victory before his retirement the following year.</p>

            <p>Grass Wonder is one of very few horses to win the Arima Kinen in back-to-back years. He is also one of very few horses to win both the Takarazuka Kinen and Arima Kinen in the same year. By the end of his career, Grass Wonder amassed nine total wins, with four of them being in Grade 1 races. Grass Wonder's legacy will remain in the record books forever.</p>

            <p><i>Umamusume</i> fans have long been supporting the horses featured in the anime series and games. Overseas fans have even gone so far as to <a href="https://namabokusobank.jp/" target="_blank" style="color: #f589a2">donate grass</a> to the retired horses. Until Grass Wonder's passing, he was actually the most supported horse on the service. There was clearly much love and appreciation for his legacy. It's a sad day for fans of Grass Wonder.</p>
