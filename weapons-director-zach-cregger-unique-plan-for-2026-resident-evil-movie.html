            <br> 
            <p>For as much praise as the critically acclaimed <i>Weapons</i> has been getting, Zach Cregger already seems eager to work on his next major project, a new <i>Resident Evil</i> film. Cregger has been suprisingly candid about the movie, sharing many distinct tidbits of information in various different interviews. Perhaps most importantly, Cregger has offered some insight on his plans for the movie's narrative direction.
            </p>

            <p>While many may have expected the director to take advantage of the franchise's rich roster of characters, it sounds like the upcoming <i>Resident Evil</i> movie is more interested in offering an original experience. Past <i>Resident Evil</i> films have struggled to stand on their own two feet, even while taking advantage of the weight of the brand, so Zach Cregger has quite a lot to prove. With him at the helm, Sony likely doesn't have much to worry about, though.</p>

            <h2>Cregger's <i>Resident Evil</i> Movie Is A Love Letter To The Games</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Zach Cregger is an unapologetic fan of the <i>Resident Evil</i> games, something that's refreshing to hear after so many failed adaptations. What makes <i>Resident Evil</i> feel so special as a series has never been properly captured on the big screen. That looks set to finally change with Cregger aiming for his story to be "obedient to the lore of the games." Above all, Cregger aims to capture the heart of the series in his upcoming film. He wants the movie to feel like a proper extension of the established IP. A true love letter to the fans.
            </p>

            <p>Zach Cregger is opting for an original story mainly out of respect for the offerings of the already released games. He explained that he feels no need to retell certain events like Leon S. Kennedy's story because fans can already experience that through the games. In fact, Cregger has no plans to use any of the series' established characters whatsoever. This movie could have been made even without the <i>Resident Evil</i> name. You can be sure to expect tie-ins in the final product, though.</p>

            <p>As for the main premise of the movie, we're still relatively light on the details. All we really know is that it will follow a person's journey as they try to reach a final destination. The horror will ramp up every step of the way as they "go deeper and deeper into the depths of Hell." A metaphorical hell, of course.</p>
