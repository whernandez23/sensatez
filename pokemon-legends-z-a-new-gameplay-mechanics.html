            <p><strong style="color: #98d09a;"><i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i></strong> isn't your average <i>Pokémon</i> game. The first gameplay trailer for the new game made that abundantly clear. <i>Legends: Z-A</i> may be considered a new mainline entry in the <i>Pokémon</i> series, but it is taking <i>Pokémon</i> in a whole new direction. 
            </p>

            <p>The <i>Pokémon</i> series' traditional, turn-based JRPG combat is no longer present in <i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i>. Instead, <i>Legends: Z-A</i> has opted for a real-time RPG battle system. As a result, <strong>Pokémon battles are now the most immersive that they have ever been</strong>. Here we'll be explaining all the different ways that the gameplay has changed in <i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i>.</p>

            <h2><i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i>: Real-Time, Action RPG Battles</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i> has been compared a lot to <i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i> ever since the first gameplay trailer dropped. Honestly, there is a lot of substance to that comparison, considering that <i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i> has adopted a very similar battle system.
            </p>

            <p>All Pokémon moves now have cooldowns attached to them. The animations of the moves also matter when it comes to timing. Your Pokémon cannot use another attack until it has completely finished using the last one. As you'll come to learn, timing is very important in <i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i>.</p>

            <p>Repositioning and swapping your Pokémon out are other options at your disposal during combat. They don't come at any cost, other than burning some time. When you swap a Pokémon in, for example, it will play an animation for a couple of seconds. That lost time is what will dissuade you from repeatedly swapping out. Likewise, repositioning takes away time where you could be attacking. Finding the right balance is how you'll find success with the new battle system.</p>

            <p>As for what has been retained from previous games, Pokémon still have the same stat distribution. Mostly. The Speed stat is interpreted differently, but everything else is carried over from previous games. The damage calculation looks to be the exact same. Type effectivity still exists, now represented via symbols on top of the moves. Abilities, however, are absent, so that is no longer a part of the calculus. PP has also been killed.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Battles Means Reactions Really Matter</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Pokémon</i> games have long rewarded carefully planned strategies. After all, in most of the series' games, you have an infinite amount of time to respond to the current gamestate. In <i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i>, that obviously isn't possible. The new combat system instead rewards quick reactions. And yes, timing and intuition really does matter there. 
            </p>

            <p>In <i>Pokémon</i> games, most attacks can be blocked with certain moves. <i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i> is no different. Protect still exists, and it will block attacks if used at the right time. Stealth Rock works similarly, damaging and interrupting any Pokémon that charges into the levitating stones when they're active. The key to these moves is actually using them before an attack. Using it haphazardly won't work. Repositioning your Pokémon follows the same principle. You actually need to react to what's happening in real-time. Different moves have different ranges, so you have to be conscious of that, too.</p>

            <h2>Mega Evolutions Run On A Timer</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Mega Evolutions are finally back in <i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i>. This time around, they're going to be balanced by the fact that they actually run on a timer. To compensate, they seem to be a little more impressive. Their moves get further powered up. More details about this will surely be available once the full game releases.
