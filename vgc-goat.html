            <p>When you think of the complete history of Smogon OU, Tyranitar is a name that's been at the top of usage rates for generation past generation. It
               has been one of the best Pokémon in singles competitions for decades now...even if Scarlet and Violet has spelled the beginning of its decline. If there's 
               any Pokémon deserving of being called the GOAT of OU, it has to be Tyranitar. There isn't really much room for discussion there. If we turn our heads to
               Pokémon's official competitions, though, how much do things change? Singles is one thing, but doubles? Has there been any one Pokémon that has reigned above
               all nearly as much? Well, let's take a look.

            <h2>1-Time VGC Winners</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Since the inception of official Pokémon tournaments in 2008, there have been only 55 distinct Pokémon who have won the competition. Out of more than 1,000 total Pokémon, it is absolutely 
               an exclusive group. 35 of them have been world champions only once as you can see above. Really, there's not a whole lot connecting all these individual Pokémon. 
               A few were niche picks even for their time of victory such as Pachirisu. Others have been powercrept since their generation of origin such as Empoleon. Some have been 
               more regular mainstays who simply haven't had better luck like Tyranitar. There's plenty of 'mons here with the potential to win more championships and there's plenty 
               who won't ever do so again.

            <h2>2-Time VGC Winners</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Compared to the 1-time winners, the 2-time winners have more discernable value. They fulfill clearer roles on a team. Bronzong's fine being a one-trick Trick Room setter.
               Amoongus' access to both Spore and Rage Powder makes it a unique support. Tapu Fini could frankly do a little bit of everything if you wanted it to. Here you can see the
               value of good team composition. You need strong damage dealers, but you also need the kind of Pokémon who can set them up for success. I wouldn't exactly say that these 
               Pokémon are timeless (Ludicolo hasn't been competitive for a good while, after all), but they'll always be able to fit into a team that needs someone like them even if
               they're no longer the best option. It'll be interesting to see how Paldean Pokémon place in the long-term. Something tells me we're going to see repeat winners in the 
               coming years...

            <h2>The GOATs</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Turns out, it's hard to pinpoint one Pokémon as the best ever. The 6 'mons here have defined various different eras of VGC tournaments. Snorlax and Metagross were early
               staples - the two of them sharing a win in the inaugural 2008 championship as well as in 2009. Salamence would find its first win as a part of that 2009 team, but it wouldn't 
               be until 2018 that it would develop into a more prominent threat thanks to the Salamencite (coincidentally, winning alongside Snorlax). All 3 of these Pokémon in the top row can say that
               they won back-to-back titles which is genuinely an impressive feat given how infrequently that has happened.</p>
               
            <p>Cresselia was an inescapable threat in the early 2010s, taking home the trophy in 2010, 2012, and 2015. Unlike the previously mentioned Pokémon, Cresselia actually does see use 
               in modern-day double battles. Although it has been a fairly viable Trick Room setter all these years since its last win, the addition of Lunar Blessing to its movepool has really 
               revived its utility. Speaking of utility, Thundurus has always been able to provide exactly that on top of elite offense. Its role on teams is ever-evolving. It just has access to
               so many useful moves - perhaps that's why it has won as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. And last but certainly not least, there's the most dominant Pokémon out 
               of this group: Incineroar. Since its introduction, its usage has only climbed to the point that it has regularly been the undisputed #1 most used Pokémon. With access to Intimidate,
               Fake Out, and Parting Shot, Incineroar has one of the best kits you could ask for out of a support 'mon. It is the only Pokémon to have ever won 3 world championships in a row. It has
               only been stopped by COVID and Game Freak removing it from the game. The Pokémon is a freak of nature and we can only wait and see if it has what it takes to be the lone best of all time.
            </p>
