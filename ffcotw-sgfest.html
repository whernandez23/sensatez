            <br> 
            <p>This year's Summer Game Fest was a real treat for SNK fans — a <i>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</i> trailer being one of the two main highlights. Although the trailer from the event was brief, there's a decent amount of info to unpack about the game. Most evidently, <b>B. Jenet</b> and <b>Vox Reaper</b> have been revealed as new fighters, bringing the roster's total to 8. Even more 
               exciting news for fans, <i>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</i> has settled on an <b>Early 2025</b> release date. Things are starting to get just a <i>little</i> more concrete.

            <br>
            <h2>Character Reveals: B. Jenet and Vox Reaper</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>B. Jenet is, of course, a returning character. Debuting in the prequel, <i>Garou: Mark of the Wolves</i>, her more than palpable popularity has made her a must-have at this point. She doesn't look all that different this time around, but I don't think anyone's complaining about that. Her backstory for <i>City of the Wolves</i> seems to be entirely centered on a fixation with Grant and Kain R. Heinlein. What that might be about hasn't been revealed, but it's probably
               safe to assume that it's entirely money-related. She <i>is</i> a pirate after all and those guys <i>are</i> wealthy crime lords.
            </p>

            <p>Vox Reaper, in contrast, is a brand-new character. That said, he clearly pays homage to a notable character from the previous entry: Grant. The connection is no accident, as Vox is, in fact, Grant's protégé. Initially a rogue street assassin for hire, a failed attempt on Kain's life ended up spiraling into a teacher-student relationship with Grant. Although Vox could have very well been killed, Grant saw plenty of potential in the troubled boy. 
               With Grant apparently in critical condition during the events of <i>City of the Wolves</i>, it's now up to Vox Reaper to maintain the wishes of his mentor and the ambitions of his boss, Kain.

            <br>
            <p>The wait for <i>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</i> won't be that long now. In the meantime, there's still a lot left of the game to show so I'd expect at least a couple more major reveals in the near future. It'll be interesting to see if we get any spotlights for the story, stages, or minigames as they haven't really gotten much focus up to this point. But hey, we'll take anything.
