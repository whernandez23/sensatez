            <br> 
            <p>It has been a long time coming; finally, there is some level of social interactivity in <i>Marvel Snap</i>. <b>Alliances</b> are <i>Marvel Snap's</i> latest and greatest feature and it promises an entirely new way to experience the game. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but, based on what the <i>Snap</i> team has shared, I do think it will change how some people
               approach the game. The key word being some.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>What Are Alliances And How Will They Impact You?</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>Think of Alliances as a new guild feature in the game; it's effectively what they are. Someone forms the Alliance at no cost other than a little bit of time, people join, then you can interact, and then there are some small benefits that the whole Alliance can work towards. This isn't some revolutionary concept. What <i>Marvel Snap</i> specifically adds to the table are bounties and participation rewards.</p>

            <p>Bounties are basically missions for the Alliance that anyone can complete within the group. It can honestly 
              be quite addicting to complete them as they're more varied than your standard missions and encourage you to play a variety of decks. As for
              the participation rewards, those will vary depending on how active the Alliance is. More bounties completed means there's more for everyone to gain. For now, those rewards don't seem all that special, but things could change quickly.</p>

            </div>

            <br>
            <h2>Chatting and Strategizing</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>The social element of Alliances isn't just restricted to some vague sense of camaraderie. You can actually communicate with each other and the game definitely encourages that. There's a chat/feed system within the Alliance tab that both allows you to see notable actions performed by your fellow group members and actually chat with them. Full typing and everything; it doesn't seem to be all that restricted. This won't have that much value for those of you who plan to join your friends' Alliances, but, hey, it's neat
               to have.
            </p>

            <p>For the competitive type, there's a table that displays all point contributors within your Alliance. If you want to take that as a challenge, by all means, go ahead. Friendly competition only serves as a net positive for everyone.</p>

            </div>
               
            <br>
            <p>Alliances make a whole lot of sense for <i>Marvel Snap</i>. Just within a few days, we'll all be wondering how we didn't get this sooner. It's fun. It's dynamic. It's <i>simple</i>. It doesn't need to be complicated.
            </p>

            <p>Lots of changes and updates are coming soon to <i>Marvel Snap</i>. Make sure to check back here if you want to learn more about them!</p>
