            <p><i>Silent Hill</i> looks to finally be back in good hands, as <strong style="color: #e80607;"><i>Silent Hill f</i></strong> represents both a departure and a return to form for the series. The formal reveal of the game in the recent Silent Hill Transmission has offered quite a lot to talk about, and the creators behind <i>Silent Hill f</i> have provided even more relevant background info. We'll be covering everything important here that we've learned about the game.

            <h2><i>Silent Hill f</i> Embraces Japanese Horror To The Fullest</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Silent Hill f</i> takes place in Japan, and that has been the plan from the very start. Even before Ryukishi07, the main writer of the game, joined the project, Konami was deadset on using Japan as the main setting. The exact reasoning for this has actually been shared, and it has everything to do with returning to the series' roots.
            </p>

            <p>From the very moment that <i>Silent Hill</i> was first conceptualized, the series has always had a connection to Japanese horror. That very specific thematic approach has always been consistent, even if the games have always taken place in a Western setting. Konami, however, apparently has gotten the impression that the series has become too Westernized. The simple resolution, therefore, was to have their next <i>Silent Hill</i> game take place in Japan.</p>

            <p><i>Silent Hill f</i>'s town of Ebisugaoka is actually based on a real-life place: Kanayama, Gero in the Gifu Prefecture. The town was chosen as the main reference for the game's setting due to its incredibly distinct design. The town's alleyways have a unique, labyrinthine quality to them, which is perfect for a <i>Silent Hill</i> game. Notably, though, <strong><i>Silent Hill f</i> takes place in the past, specifically the 1960s</strong>. The chosen time period will seemingly be of great importance — more on that in the next section.</p>

            <h2>What Themes Will <i>Silent Hill f</i> Focus On?</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">The first question that Ryukishi07 had to ask himself upon joining the <i>Silent Hill f</i> project was, "What exactly is Silent Hill?" As we have known it, Silent Hill has traditionally meant a very specific location. The concept of Silent Hill is much more than that, however. It's a place where fear, sin, self-doubt, and the true horrors of the mind all come together. That's what Ryukishi07 has honed in on with his script, and that's partly why the team was so confident in using an entirely new setting.
            </p>

            <p><i>Silent Hill</i> games have really made their female characters suffer. That won't change much here, as Shimizu Hanako, the protagonist of <i>Silent Hill f</i>, will have to face many horrors throughout this new game. Interestingly, though, Ryukishi07 did mention that he didn't just want Hanako to be a passenger through the story. It seems that <i>Silent Hill f</i> will allow the player to make more decisions for themselves. Curiously, the press release for the game mentions that Hanako must "ultimately choose between beauty and madness." I don't think those words were chosen haphazardly.</p>

            <p>Disclaimers for <i>Silent Hill f</i> mention gender discrimination, child abuse, bullying, drug-induced hallucinations, graphic violence, and torture. Is there a connection somewhere? Yes, actually. Disclaimers for the game also clarify that the game focuses on outdated customs from Japan in the 1960s. From the sound of things, <strong><i>Silent Hill f</i> looks set to explore the ugly aspects of Japan's old traditions and expectations</strong>.</p>

            <p>Horror in beauty is what <i>Silent Hill f</i> will be all about. The red spidier lilies that we see in the reveal trailer represent that well. The theme has also reportedly been a strong source of inspiration for the designs of the monsters in the game. We definitely need to see a lot more, but what we've seen already gives plenty of reason to be excited.</p>
