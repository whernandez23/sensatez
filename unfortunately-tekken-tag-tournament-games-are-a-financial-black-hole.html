            <br> 
            <p>Recently, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-developers-discuss-miary-zo-tekken-tag-tournament-and-season-2-evo-2025" target="_blank" style="color: #ff2945">IGN got to ask a few big-name <i>Tekken</i> developers</a> about the possibility of a new <i>Tekken Tag Tournament</i> game. Considering how the fighting game scene looks ready to embrace a tag-team-heavy future, it certainly made sense to ask about it. Katsuhiro Harada, <i>Tekken</i>'s executive director, has thrown cold water on the idea, however.
            </p>

            <p>Harada seems to be firmly against the concept of a <i>Tekken Tag Tournament 3</i>, mainly citing the challenge of having players buy into a game that requires twice the learning of a standard <i>Tekken</i> title. And frankly, Harada is right. Casual audiences have historically been averse to tag fighters for that very reason. Moreover, the <i>Tekken</i> series' sales history tells a clear story: it really isn't worth making a <i>Tekken Tag Tournament</i> game.</p>

            <h2><i>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</i> Was A Financial Flop</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">You don't have to look too far to see why the <i>Tekken</i> team wants no part in a new tag fighter. <i>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</i> was a massive flop. It remains <strong>the series' worst-selling title with just 1.8 million copies sold</strong>. While the game didn't exactly put the series at risk of being killed, it would have its ramifications. <i>Tekken 7</i>, for example, had a tighter budget. Even now, the higher-ups at Bandai Namco expect <i>Tekken 8</i> to be a profit machine every passing year.
            </p>

            <p>Financial failures leave a lasting damage on the creative process. <i>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</i> just happened to be made in a time where that was okay to innocently ignore. Certainly, the <i>Tekken</i> team must have had the belief that the amount of effort put into the development of that game would be well-rewarded. After all, it is almost obscenely jam-packed with content. Unfortunately, they were well off the mark. Turns out, spoiling your fan base isn't worth it if you can't actually get people to buy your game.</p>


            <p><i>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</i> failed for various different reasons. Its biggest issue, in retrospect, was that it felt too much like a game designed for hardcore <i>Tekken</i> players. Who else would actually care that much about all of the game's features? And who else would actually care to learn how to play two distinct characters in a franchise known for its extreme difficulty? The lack of forethought back then clearly weighs on Harada's mind, because, in his interview with IGN, he specifically addressed how the <i>Tekken Tag Tournament</i> games often alienate casual audiences. No casual players means poor sales. A new <i>Tekken Tag Tournament</i> game is too financially risky to really consider.</p>

            <h2>Tag Fighting Could End Up As A Future Game Mode</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">While the <i>Tekken Tag Tournament</i> spin-off series might be as good as dead, the <i>Tekken</i> team seems relatively open to the idea of potentially including a tag-team mode in a more standard <i>Tekken</i> title. Instead of making a separate game with a separate budget, it probably does make more sense to include something like that as an addendum to a more traditional experience. Tag fighting as the main appeal just isn't something that can work for <i>Tekken</i>. It never has. It probably never will.
