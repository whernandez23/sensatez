            <p>Anime NYC is a relatively young convention, debuting in 2017, but it has already established itself as one of New York's biggest conventions. With over 100,000 attendees in its 2024 iteration, Anime NYC has become a premiere destination for fans of Japanese culture. 2025 marks the first year that the convention is offering a fourth day, and, I've got to say, it's a great addition. So long as it continues to have a major event such as Netflix's presentation this year, the experience is definitely worthwhile.</strong>

            <h2>A Quick Word On The Convention Space</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">In concept, Thursday sounded like it was going to be relatively sparse in terms of people. Just one major panel? A lot of artists and booths still not properly set up? It didn't really make a difference, though. The convention center wasn't exactly packed full, but there were a lot of people in attendance. Lines for the major booths could easily take over 30 minutes of waiting. Items were selling out in some places after just 2 hours of being open. By all means, Thursday was a big success story. Hopefully it offers more in the years to come.</p>

            <h2>Netflix Presents: SAKAMOTO DAYS</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Before I say anything about <i>SAKAMOTO DAYS</i>, I really would like to praise the production team behind this Netflix event. It was incredibly well-organized. On top of that, the host was great, the questions for the guests felt insightful, and the free goodies were pretty nice, too. I want to give major props to the audio systems in the main stage, as well. The sound quality is gorgeous in there. In conjunction with the cheers of the crowd, it was an almost surreal experience.
            </p>

            <p>Now to actually talk about the anime presentations, it was hard to expect much news out of <i>SAKAMOTO DAYS</i>. Episodes from the first season are still airing. A preview of the future of the JCC Arc was very welcome, though. A more in-depth look at Nao Taromaru, Sakamoto's high schooler superfan, is probably the biggest thing of interest in the mid-season trailer. Her white braids were the only thing that had been teased and directly shown prior to this. Other than Nao, fans of the anime may be intrigued by how much Akira is being set up as a central figure. Definitely expect more from her.</p>

            <h2>Netflix Presents: Record of Ragnarok III</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Record of Ragnarok</i> is a series that has surpassed all expectations. Despite the hate it has gotten, its popularity is undeniable. The third season promises an even better experience. The budget seems to be in a better place, at least. The animation quality has clearly taken a step forward. <i>Record of Ragnarok III</i> will start with the seventh fight in Ragnarok: the final battle between the gods and humans.

            <h2>Netflix Presents: Blue Eye Samurai</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">A look at the second season of <i>Blue Eye Samurai</i> was definitely something of note. Mizu is certainly going to have quite the tough time working here way through London. The talk on-stage with Michael Green and Jane Wu was just as much of a highlight, though. Green really stressed the importance of the show to his family. Mizu is, in a way, almost a stand-in for his wife and co-creator, Amber Noizumi.
            </p>

            <p>Mizu's energy is a direct reflection of Noizumi's as she was growing up, just with an actual sword. Green also shared that the name of the show actually comes from a nickname for their daughter. While her daughter's clearly mixed identity was something that Noizumi didn't initially know how to feel about, the acceptance of her reality has clearly grown into something very profound. Jane Wu taking on the job was also rooted in a desire to champion proper Asian representation. Mizu isn't some stereotype. She is a strong individual for simply being who she is. There's a good reason why the show has garnered so many fans.</p>

            <p>One last funny tidbit: Michael Green joked that the main difference between Season 1 and Season 2 of <i>Blue Eye Samurai</i> was that they actually had fans now.</p>

            <h2>Netflix Presents: Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</h2>  

            <p class="arh2-spc">Prior to this event, I doubt many were looking deep into the creators behind <i>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</i>. The writer behind the <i>John Wick</i> series, Derek Kolstad, is a perfect fit as the lead writer, though. You just get the sense that <i>Splinter Cell</i> is in good hands. The way Kolstad talked about the series at the event, there was a clear appreciation for the IP. And if there's someone who can handle the action that fans would expect, it's definitely Kolstad.
            </p>

            <p><i>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</i> takes place years after Sam Fisher has retired. Other details are a bit murky at the moment, but Kolstad did mention that they have tried to respect the source material. This show will try to feel true to <i>Splinter Cell</i>. That's all anyone wants to hear.</p>

            <h2>Netflix Presents: Devil May Cry Season 2</h2>  

            <p class="arh2-spc">The second season of <i>Devil May Cry</i> will pit the two brothers, Dante and Vergil, against each other. The teasing from the end of the first season is actually paying off. Everyone's sporting some slightly different looks now, as well. As expected, though, the show is going to tell its own version of the story from the games. Big fans of the franchise are still going to have a lot to hate there.</p>
