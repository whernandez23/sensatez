            <br> 
            <p>A completely unexpected addition to the <i>Dragon Ball</i> franchise is on the horizon. <i>Dragon Ball Project: Multi</i> has been announced for PC and mobile devices and it will be translating the series into a MOBA for the first time ever.
            </p>

            <p>Believe me, this game could end up being a huge deal if Bandai Namco plays their cards right. It may not exactly seem uber polished based on what has been shown to us, but, with such a strong IP, that might not even really matter when it comes to outreach. Regardless, everyone will have the opportunity
               to participate in the upcoming beta test so we'll have a better idea of the game's quality sooner rather than later.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Everything Shown So Far — Fighters, Gameplay, And More</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>When it comes to anything <i>Dragon Ball</i>, the playable characters are always so, so crucial to the experience. It just doesn't really feel like <i>Dragon Ball</i> if you don't have thousands of options to choose from. That, of course, is an exaggeration, but the idea still rings true. So, how well is <i>Project: Multi</i> doing in that department? Well, we can't tell you the full roster size because that information isn't out yet, but we can confirm the presence of 13 characters, including:</p>

            <ul>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Goku</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Vegeta</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Krillin</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Piccolo</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Kid Gohan</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Future Trunks</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Android 18</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Majin Buu</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Zamasu</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Cooler</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some other familiar faces are also present in the minute-long trailer, but those characters seem to have been relegated to map bosses. Android 16 and Champa are the standout names there. While we're talking about Champa, it seems like all of his fellow Gods of Destruction will also serve as bosses. That's based off of a very brief appearance of Belmod in the trailer via an in-game cut-in. The Supreme Kais of every Universe may also serve similar roles.
            </p>

            <p>For the moment, it's unclear what the primary win condition for the game is. It's honestly unclear what you'll be doing throughout <i>any</i> part of the game, aside from throwing hands with your opponent. The trailer suggests that grabbing the Dragon Ball from the center of the map will guarantee your victory, but...that seems way too easy. We'll just have to wait and see how things really operate. The same goes for all those cinematic cutscenes — really, there's no way of knowing how that will work in real-time.
               Moves can be flashy in MOBAs, but they're not <i>that</i> flashy.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p><i>Dragon Ball Project: Multi</i> has a lot to live up to. Expectations are absolutely going to be high. People have been waiting for something like this for a long while. Some half-assed mobile game just won't cut it. For everyone's sake, I really do hope that this game can be a fun experience.
            </p>

            <p>If you'd like to play the game early, make sure to join the regional beta test as soon as it starts on <b>August 20th @ 6:00 AM UTC</b>. It will be available in 8 different countries on the App Store, Google Play, and Steam and will be live for almost 2 full weeks. Don't miss it!</p>
