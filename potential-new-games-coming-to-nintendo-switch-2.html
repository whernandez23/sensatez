            </div>
            <br> 
            <p>For the first time in a long time, Nintendo actually has the hardware to run modern games, thanks to the generational leap to the Nintendo Switch 2. Or, at least, that's the expectation. It is still to be seen how well the Switch 2 can actually run recent releases. A lot of compromises may still need to be made.
            </p>

            <p>That all being said, rumors surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2 seem to have pretty high expectations for third-party support. Within just a year, the Switch 2 could be stacked with all kinds of major franchises and titles. Let's explore some of the biggest potential partners for games on the Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>

            <h2>Nintendo, Obviously — Metroid Prime 4 and Pokémon Legends: Z-A</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Neither <i>Metroid Prime 4</i> nor <i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i> currently have a set release date. Now, this doesn't guarantee that they're being optimized for the Switch 2, but that may very well be the case. These two games would likely push the first Nintendo Switch to its absolute limits. Most gamers would surely appreciate being able to <strong>experience these two games with
               better visuals and performance instead</strong>, especially with their releases being within such close proximity to the new console. At the very least, these two games should surely have improved versions designed just for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <h2>Square Enix — Mainline Final Fantasy Back To The Big N</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">The rumors around the Nintendo Switch 2 seem to be <em>very</em> confident that <strong>the <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> remakes will be coming to the new console</strong>. Depending on who you ask, you're going to get very different answers about that. There seems to be a consensus, however, that <i>Final Fantasy VII Remake</i> will be made available this year for the Switch 2. <i>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</i>, on the other hand, may not release until 2026. That's assuming that the
                Switch 2 can even run it, of course.
            </p>

            <p>Nintendo and Square Enix have maintained a fairly strong relationship over the years. That doesn't seem likely to change at all with Nintendo's next generation. If anything, we might see the companies closer than they've ever been since the days of the SNES.</p>

            <h2>Atlus — Metaphor: ReFantazio and Persona 6</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Metaphor: ReFantazio</i> may be Atlus' biggest ever release. It's a great thing then that it'll find new life on the Nintendo Switch 2. <i>Metaphor</i> may not need the extra sales, but, hey, the game is absolutely perfect for a portable console. The new system would also give Atlus a perfect excuse to release a definitive edition, which Atlus already loves to make for their games.

            <p><strong><i>Persona 6</i> is also expected to release on the Nintendo Switch 2</strong>. That game hasn't even been announced as of the time of this writing, but it has been talked about for months by leakers as a future Switch 2 title. <i>Persona 6</i> probably won't be an exclusive release or a launch title, though. In all likelihood, <i>Persona 6</i> will just have the standard multi-platform release, now including Nintendo's new platform.</p>

            <h2>Microsoft — New Call of Duty Games Guaranteed</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">Before their full acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft made a promise involving Nintendo that didn't really make much sense at the time. But now with a more powerful console, it makes plenty of sense. Nintendo and Microsoft have signed a 10-year contract that <strong>will ensure that new <i>Call of Duty</i> games release on the Nintendo Switch 2</strong>. Furthermore, the games will release uncompromised, in terms of content, and on the same day as on other consoles.
            </p>

            <p>Nintendo's agreement with Microsoft is specific to <i>Call of Duty</i>. If the two companies are working well together, however, there may be room for more games. At the very least, it's great that Nintendo has secured third-party support here. Nintendo might have other similar agreements in place with other companies that simply haven't been made public.</p>

            <h2>Konami — Metal Gear Solid Delta and Silent Hill</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">A newly designed <i>Metal Gear</i> game on a Nintendo console...Coincidentally, the last time that happened was when Konami released <i>Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D</i> on the 3DS back in 2012. Over a decade later, the Nintendo Switch 2 can finally remedy that drought with the help of <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>.
            </p>

            <p>While <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i> seemed sure to be released in 2024, Konami got quiet about the remake in the latter half of last year. Perhaps the game has been delayed. Perhaps it was always meant to take this long. Either way, the timeline is just about right for the game to come out on the Switch 2. And indeed, <strong>there is a strong belief that <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta</i> will find its way onto Nintendo's new system</strong>.</p>

            <p>As for <i>Silent Hill</i>, there is only speculation that the <i>Silent Hill 2</i> remake will end up on the Nintendo Switch 2. That may become reality. It may not. Konami has other <i>Silent Hill</i> projects coming in the near future. Those have a better chance of releasing on the Switch 2, as they are probably now being developed with the system already in mind.</p>

            <h2>Ubisoft — A Little Bit Of Everything (Mostly Assassins)</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">Ubisoft is very open to porting old games. The same is going to happen with this next generation of Nintendo hardware. A lot of games that never made their way onto the Nintendo Switch will find a home on the Switch 2. As for new games, it seems that <strong>Ubisoft really wants <i>Assassin's Creed Shadows</i> on the Switch 2</strong>. It seems that development of the port is a bit behind schedule, though, so it's unlikely to be available during the console's launch window.
            </p>

            <div>
               <img src="images/potential-new-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2_assassinscreedshadows.jpg" width="100%" class="center" alt="Assassins Creed Shadows will release on the Switch 2. Ubisoft will also port over various old games to the new Nintendo console.">
            </div>

            <br>

            <p>If the Steam Deck can handle almost every game on the market, you'd best believe that the sky is the limit when it comes to games on the Nintendo Switch 2 console. Third-party support doesn't look like it'll be a problem at all. With how well the first Nintendo Switch did, it would be totally unwise to not make games for this new hardware. And regardless of how other publishers feel, Nintendo is still going to spoil us with amazing games. There's a lot to look forward to with the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
