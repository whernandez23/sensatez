            <p>The <i>Monster Hunter Wilds</i> Showcase packed a lot of info into its short runtime. There's no doubt, however, that the announcement of the game's open beta test was the showcase's major highlight.</p>

            <p>The open beta test will be publicly playable for everyone on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC from <b>October 31 @ 8:00 PM through November 3 @ 6:59 PM</b>. PlayStation Plus members will get exclusive early access, their test period running from <b>October 28 @ 8:00 PM through October 30 @ 7:59 PM</b>.</p>
            </p>

            <p>The <i>Monster Hunter Wilds</i> open beta test offers three distinct experiences: character creation, a Story Trial, and a free-roaming Doshaguma Hunt. Here, we'll be breaking down each one of those experiences.</p>

            <h2>Explore the Complete Character Creation Tool and Let Your Imagination Run Wild</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>In the <i>Monster Hunter Wilds</i> open beta test, players will be able to use the complete character creation tool — the very same one that will be available in the full game. You will be able to remake your character as many times as you'd like, so you can try out all kinds of different looks to see what you like best. Both the hunter and the palico will be customizable.</p>

            <p>Character creation data can be carried over to the full game once it releases. Of course, you'll just have to make sure that you're using the same device. There are a lot of customizable features so do take your time in trying to make your perfect creation!</p>

            <h2>Try Out The Story Trial And Learn The Game's Mechanics</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>The open beta test's Story Trial is mainly there to serve as a tutorial system. It does cover some of the game's opening sequences, after all, so that just makes sense. Players will be able to hunt a Chatacabra, getting a feel for the weapon mechanics and story along the way. It's a small taste of what the full game will have to offer.</p>

            <p>The Story Trial, as well as the Doshaguma Hunt, can be taken on in multiplayer. Players just need to use an SOS Flare to play with others online. Alternatively, you can fight alongside NPC Support Hunters. Just keep in mind that the maximum party size is four. <b>This game's multiplayer will support crossplay</b>, so you can play with people on different platforms.</p>

            <h2>Full Freedom To Explore In The Doshaguma Hunt</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>In the Doshaguma Hunt, players will be able to explore the Windward Plains in their pursuit of the Alpha of a Doshaguma pack. Riding on a Seikret, you'll be able to move quickly around the world. You'll also be able to try out two different weapons in this hunt. This "mode" honestly represents the full <i>Monster Hunter Wilds</i> experience as much as the Story Trial, if not more. Moving around to hunt is a pillar of the series, after all. This also presents a much better opportunity to get a feel for the environment.</p>

            </div>

            <br>

            <p>All open beta participants will receive a bonus Palico pendant and an item pack, both of which can be claimed in the full game. That's not much, but it's extra incentive to try out the game. And again, do note that this <i>is</i> an open beta test, so the experience might not be perfect for everyone. But it is free and you can try it out with friends. These two things will always triumph over everything else. Don't miss out on this open beta test!
