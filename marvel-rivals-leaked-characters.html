            <p>In the short time that <i>Marvel Rivals</i> has been officially out, the game has really impressed. At this point, calling it an <i>Overwatch</i> clone would be completely unjust. And truly, what separates <i>Marvel Rivals</i> from a "clone" like <i>Paladins</i> is the power of its IP. People care about <i>Marvel</i> characters. People really care about who will next be playable.
            </p>

            <p>Luckily, for those of you who can't wait, <i>Marvel Rivals</i> leaks have had a lot to share in terms of upcoming characters. <strong>In total, 8 characters have been leaked</strong> with a few more also potentially in play (more on that later). Now, when will they be arriving? Well, that's not exactly all that clear yet, but some are definitely more ready than others. Alright, now let's take a quick look at the future ahead.</p>

            <h2>Blade — The Vampire Hunter Smells Blood</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Blade is one of a few leaked characters in the <i>Marvel Rivals</i> files to actually have a model associated with the character. Unfortunately, no other details are available at the moment. Still, with the model fully developed, Blade surely isn't <em>too far</em> from release.</p> 

            <div>
               <img src="images/marvel-rivals-leaked-characters_blade.jpg" width="100%" class="center" alt="Blade's model has been leaked for Marvel Rivals, notably including a sword but no other weapons">
            </div>

            <br>
            <h2>Emma Frost — A Diamond In The Rough</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">Emma Frost will be making it into <i>Marvel Rivals</i> and we know that thanks to her Diamond Form being present in a string of code. That's a dead giveaway. We also have a list of her abilities, which includes: Psychic Blast, Psychic Ray, Psychic Barrier, Diamond Form, Diamond Shock, Diamond Kick, Diamond Back Slam, Soul Control, Mind Control, Mind Connection, and Piercing Spikes.</p>

            <p>It's probably safe to say that Emma's Diamond Form is going to play a big part in making her feel unique. Her whole movekit seems to change after she transforms, after all. As for what kind of role she'll fulfill, that's a bit dubious. Mind control powers don't exactly suggest that she'll be a Vanguard, but a move like "Psychic Barrier" does seem appropriate for the role. Emma Frost's Diamond Form is also known for being extremely durable, so...</p>

            <h2>Human Torch — A Storm Is Approaching</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">It has been known for a while that the Human Torch would be making his way into the game. In fact, he seemed just about ready to make it into the base roster. That didn't exactly happen, but he is certainly a candidate to make it in next. In terms of how he'll play, Flame Fields seem to be a big part of the Human Torch's game. He can create them via Blazing Blast and then connect them into a fire wall or turn them into Flame Tornadoes, using Pyro Prison and Supernova, respectively.</p> 

            <p>Of course, the Human Torch can also fly. He can both accelerate up quickly and soar straight up. One team up ability that he has is with another flier, Storm. The ability is called Omega Fire and he can turn Storm's hurricane into a fiery hurricane that boosts the power of any Flame Tornadoes in the hurricane's path. It's a bit hard to conceptualize...we'll just have to see it in action.</p>

               <img src="images/marvel-rivals-leaked-characters_humantorch.png" width="100%" class="center" alt="Johnny Storm, the Human Torch, has been redesigned in Marvel Rivals. Previous leaks had him looking a lot uglier.">
            </div>

            <br>
            <h2>Invisible Woman — Invisible In The Files, Too</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">You can't have the Fantastic Four without Invisible Woman. These <i>Marvel Rivals</i> files definitely seem to be missing her, though. While the rest of the Four have, at the very least, had their designs leaked, almost nothing noteworthy about Invisible Woman has been found. Presumably, she'll be a Strategist, but even that is far from being something definitive.</p> 

            <br>
            <h2>Jean Gray — Phoenix Powers</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Jean Gray is all about the Phoenix in <i>Marvel Rivals</i>. Much like Emma Frost, we mostly just have her move list at this point. Jean Gray's list of abilities includes: Phoenix Shadow, Phoenix Ray, Phoenix Punishment, Psychic Explosion, Telekinetic Explosion, Phoenix Wings Flying, Telekinetic Transfer, Psychokinetic Transfer, Shattered Star Impact, and Phoenix Elegy. She is also confirmed to have a team up ability with Wolverine.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>Mister Fantastic — Expansion Character</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">Mister Fantastic looks ready to join at any moment. His model is fully visible in the files and his moves are available in full detail. For the most part, Mister Fantastic is going to play exactly how you would expect him to play. His stretching powers will give him incredible melee range; various attacks of his will make use of his elongated arms.</p>

            <p>Mister Fantastic's passive, Elastic Strength, is also pretty interesting. The player is effectively rewarded for just using his abilities repeatedly. The snowball effect might make Reed Richards an incredibly competent character when played optimally. Passive healing and boosted damage for basically free just seems <em>really</em> good.</p>

            <div>
               <img src="images/marvel-rivals-leaked-characters_misterfantastic.jpg" width="100%" class="center" alt="Mister Fantastic's stretching powers will make him a unique attacker in Marvel Rivals">
            </div>

            <br>
            <h2>The Thing — Body Of Rock, Heart Of Gold</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">Rounding out the Fanastic Four is none other than The Thing. The image below is all we have of him, though. Your guess is as good as mine as for what's going to make him a unique character. But, surely, he'll be a Vanguard, right?</p> 

            <div>
               <img src="images/marvel-rivals-leaked-characters_thething.png" width="100%" class="center" alt="In Marvel Rivals, The Thing looks like...The Thing. Hard to change the design much">
            </div>

            <br>
            <h2>Ultron — A New Age Of Support</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">If you think a majority of the support characters in <i>Marvel Rivals</i> are pretty lame, well, Ultron will remedy that just a little bit. While it's definitely shocking to see Ultron in the Strategist role, he will fulfill a fairly necessary niche. He's a healer that can fly. That's a pretty big deal.</p> 

            <p>The majority of Ultron's movekit is centered around the use of drones. Imperative: Patch is a move that will summon a giant drone to follow an ally, healing within a radius. Imperative: Firewall is a move that will summon drones to grant bonus health to all allies within a range between Ultron and the ally marked by Imperative: Patch. Rage of Ultron, his ultimate, will summon Ultra Drones to fire Encephalo Rays, either damaging enemies or healing allies.</p>

            <p>Apparently, Ultron isn't too far from release, so he's definitely something to look out for in the weeks ahead. Maybe he'll finally encourage some players to pick up a support character.</p>

            <div>
               <img src="images/marvel-rivals-leaked-characters_ultron.png" width="100%" class="center" alt="Ultron will add to the relatively weak cast of healers in Marvel Rivals">
            </div>

            <br>
            <h2>Angela, Captain Marvel, Deadpool, Hit-Monkey, and Shuri</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">Several characters are vaguely mentioned via small things like voice lines found in the game's files. That holds true for Angela, Captain Marvel, Deadpool, Hit-Monkey and Shuri in very different capacities. Out of all the characters mentioned, Angela probably has the strongest evidence to be an eventual playable character. Nothing's guaranteed, though.</p>
