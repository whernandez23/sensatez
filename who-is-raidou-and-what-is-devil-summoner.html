            <p>Of all the games that Atlus could have remastered, <i>Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army</i> isn't exactly one that carries a whole lot of nostalgia. That isn't really Atlus' fault, though. The company's old catalog of games is comprised almost entirely of titles that never really reached a large audience. Atlus' success on the global stage is a more modern development.
            </p>

            <p>With that being the case, everyone can be forgiven for not being all that familiar with who Raidou Kuzunoha is. Or the <i>Devil Summoner</i> series as a whole, for that matter. If you're interested in <strong style="color: #ccc2b3;"><i>RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army</i></strong>, a quick primer certainly wouldn't hurt.</p>

            <h2>What Is The <i>Devil Summoner</i> Series All About?</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Before we talk about Raidou, it's probably best to talk about the series he hails from first. The <i>Devil Summoner</i> series essentially branches off from the bigger franchise that is <i>Shin Megami Tensei</i>. All <i>Devil Summoner</i> games take place in the same universe as <i>Shin Megami Tensei If...</i> What makes the series unique is that it goes for more of an urban fantasy aesthetic compared to <i>SMT</i>. More street work, less apocalyptic settings. Of course, the actual act of devil summoning also takes a greater focus.
            </p>

            <p>Raidou's games could actually be considered their own spin-offs from the <i>Devil Summoner</i> series. They chronologically serve as prequels, taking place in the 1930s. Notably, however, the gameplay is completely distinct. <i>Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army</i> and <i>Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon</i> are action RPGs. The combat is in real-time, and you can even use demons for field skills. Most everything else, though — such as stats and demon fusion — is unchanged from your average <i>Megami Tensei</i> experience.</p>

            <h2>So Who Is Raidou Kuzunoha?</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc"><strong style="color: #45ce48;">Raidou Kuzunoha XIV</strong> comes from a long line of devil summoners who have been protecting Japan for over a millenia. The title of "Raidou Kuzunoha" is actually one to be earned, even among members of the family, and this Raidou has just gotten to that part by the events of <i>Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army</i>. Raidou is eventually entrusted with protecting the capital, which is why he ends up working as an assistant detective.

            <p>Raidou has been trained to defend himself and others, so he doesn't just rely on his wits. He wields a pair of katana and carries a gun. Both are fundamental to his combat prowess in-game. Of course, Raidou is also able to summon demons. He can command them directly, but he's also fine with letting them take their own initiative in battle. Raidou has access to the unique skill of Confinement, which is what allows him to turn demons into allies in the first place. Respect is something to be earned.</p>
