            <br> 
            <p>The <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> TCG is shaking things up with the introduction of a brand-new format called Genesys. A fully supported tournament system, Genesys aims to redefine the modern <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> experience. While it isn't exactly a simplified format, Genesys certainly looks to bring in players that are tired of the current Advanced meta game. The format is a lot more friendly to players who want <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> to feel more like it used to.</p>

            <h2>What Genesys Brings To The Table</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">No Pendulum Monsters, no Link Monsters, no Extra Monster Zones, and all cards are legal — those are the the main changes of interest in the new Genesys format. Very obviously, Genesys attempts to turn back the clock, hoping for a slower pace and more room for spontaneity. The original game field is used, specifically the one from Master Rules 1 and 2. In lieu of a Forbidden and Limited list, deck construction works off of a point system.</p>

            <p>Deck-building requires a little more thought in the Genesys format. By default, cards cost 0 points. The stronger they are, however, the more likely they'll contribute to the point cap, which is standardized at 100 points. Tournament organizers can actually change this number to their liking. The point cost of each card isn't up to interpretation, however. Their costs have already been predetermined by Konami <a href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/genesys/" target="_blank" style="color: #e6304b">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Balance is important in the Genesys format, as staying under the arbitrary point cap is mandatory. It's crucial to note that the cost of cards in the Main Deck, Extra Deck, and Side Deck all contribute to a player's total point cost. Now, the point system might sound strict, but it does leave room for creativity. Is a Pot of Greed worth it over a typical deck staple? That's a decision some players will have to make. Having the liberty to even make that choice is a breath of fresh air.</p>

          <h2>Lower Power, More Randomness...More Fun?</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">The Genesys format offers an alternative approach to balancing the TCG. And indeed, this new meta game levels out the playing field a lot better. Weaker decks have more room to shine, now able to support themselves with even better staple cards. Newer, meta-defining decks are also still playable, for the most part. They just happen to be more strictly regulated — particularly if they don't let opponents actually play the game. 
            
            <p>Genesys intentionally hopes to produce slower matches. More importantly, though, the average length of a turn should be significantly less. The lack of Link Monsters really hampers the combo ability of a good amount of decks. Fans of the game who are tired of seeing one-sided matches with 5-minute-long turns can finally find some reprieve.</p>

            <p>Players will most certainly try to optimize this new format to the best of their ability. It's unlikely that a perfect strategy exists, though. With so many cards now fully legal in Genesys, there are more ways to stop your opponent dead in their tracks than ever before. And even if a certain strategy is significantly better than the rest, Konami can simply adjust the price cost of certain cards. In concept, Genesys is a really intriguing way to play <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i>.</p>
