            <p>In a little less than a week, <i>Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO</i> will be fully upon us. The next big game in the <i>Dragon Ball</i> franchise promises a lot of action and fun. <i>Sparking! ZERO</i> looks to be an insanely expansive game, to the point where it will be almost impossible to fully cover everything it has to offer.
            </p>

            <p>With the release date quickly approaching, more detailed information about <i>Sparking! ZERO</i> is slowly starting to trickle out. The most recent developments are related to the game's ranked mode. For a while now, we've known that a point system would be implemented in ranked battles. It's only very recently, however, that the full details
               have begun to emerge.</p>

            <h2>Limited Points, Unlimited Creativity</h2> 
            <br>

            <p><i>Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO</i>'s ranked mode will implement a limited <b>15-point system</b>, forcing players to build a team based on the point value assigned to each character. This is effectively how the ranked mode is supposed to balance itself. The strongest characters will not be able to fight alongside each other. That doesn't necessarily mean that you
               can stack your team with really weak characters, however. <b>The maximum team size, as far as has been previosly stated, is 5.</b> Some strategizing is definitely needed.</p>

            <p>The point values for every character have all been leaked by now. For the most part, they make a whole lot of sense. Well, they do if you personally consider Super Saiyan 4 to be on par with Super Saiyan Blue...I have my own thoughts on that, but it's nothing particularly relevant.
            </p> 

            <p>One really cool thing about the point system is that many iconic character groups fit just perfectly into a team together. The Ginyu Force is the quintessential example, along with other favorites like Androids 16, 17, and 18, Universe 6's base form Saiyans, and the Kamikaze Fireballs. A lot of thought was clearly put into this point system.</p>

            <p><i>Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO</i> is going to be quite the exciting experience. There's no doubt about that. The game's ranked mode is just one facet of the very complete journey that awaits us. Still, it's good to know how exactly this mode will operate. Since we know how much everyone costs now, I suppose it's not a bad thing to get a head start on team building.
               What teams are <i>you</i> planning to use?</p>
