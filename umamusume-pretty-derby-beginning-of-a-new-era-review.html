      <br>
      <p>Anime NYC offered an exclusive screening of <i>Umamusume: Pretty Derby — Beginning of a New Era</i>, and it was impossible to pass up on that opportunity. The <i>Umamusume</i> brand is still trying to feel out its worldwide influence, which is why this movie, as of the time of writing, isn't so easily accessible for audiences. The excitement behind the film didn't feel like that of a niche franchise, though. The line for this screening was immense, with a lot of attendees unable to actually even get in.</p>

      <p>At its core, <i>Umamusume: Pretty Derby — Beginning of a New Era</i> does very much feel like a movie that was made mostly for its fans. There are a lot of references and character appearances that will only matter to players invested in the series. The panel room frequently erupted with cheers and laughs — the kind of energy you only get from a very strong fandom. That being said, even if you're not a long-time <i>Umamusume</i> fan, you can still appreciate the movie for what it offers. It's compelling. It looks beautiful. Thematically, it takes itself very seriously. It may be a movie about horse girls, but it has genuine artistic value.

      <h2>Enjoyability: 10/12 — Believe, Believe, Believe</h2>
      <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Umamusume: Pretty Derby — Beginning of a New Era</i> has no problem exploring some heavier emotions, but, fundamentally, it is a feel-good movie. It's a film that wants you actively cheering on the characters for their accomplishments. Every win is supposed to feel big, whether on the race track or outside of it. Undying optimism is the goal, both for the movie and its characters. It's hard to finish the film without a smile on your face.

      <p><i>Umamusume: Pretty Derby — Beginning of a New Era</i> is comfortable with being silly at times, and it's often refreshing for the story. The contrast between the highs and lows of the film serves the overall experience better. The fact that it's so easy to get invested in the races, despite the quirky moments in between, is a testament to how the film understands exactly how to entertain its audience.</p>

      <h2>Characters: 11/12 — Captivating Careers</h2>
      <p class="arh2-spc">What makes the <i>Umamusume</i> series so well-loved is its cast of characters. There's a horse girl for everyone. <i>Umamusume: Pretty Derby — Beginning of a New Era</i> kinda tackles that head-on. Jungle Pocket is unmistakably the main protagonist, but her rash and cocky personality doesn't define the movie. In fact, her character is grounded by the completely different personalities around her. Agnes Tachyon, Manhattan Cafe, Dantsu Flame, Fuji Kiseki — they all have their own appeal and add something unique to the movie.
      </p> 

      <p>One thing that <i>Umamusume: Pretty Derby — Beginning of a New Era</i> does particularly well is its character development. Almost every single character in the main cast grows in some shape, way, or form. Jungle Pocket, in particular, goes through a massive amount of development. Her experiences truly shape who she becomes by the end of the film. In fact, it's a crucial part of the story. <i>Beginning of a New Era</i> treats its characters right, using them intelligently through its narrative.</p>

      <h2>Cinematography: 9/12 — Flashy When It Wants To Be</h2> 
      <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Umamusume: Pretty Derby — Beginning of a New Era</i> looks really nice for the most part, but it honestly struggles a bit in motion. There are just times where the animation quality looks cheap, and some shots and sequences are used simply to avoid having to do more work. This isn't some big-budget film, so that's perfectly understandable. The racing would have simply been further enhanced by a little more polish. The biggest moments clearly got priority, and that works out fine. There is still plenty of spectacle, and most moments carry real weight.</p>

      <h2>Story: 10/12 — Deep Impact</h2> 
      <p class="arh2-spc">It's impressive how thematically rich <i>Umamusume: Pretty Derby — Beginning of a New Era</i> is. When even ramune soda has a symbolic meaning relevant to the events of the story, you can tell that the narrative has been worked on thoroughly. At first, <i>Beginning of a New Era</i> seems like a typical story about rising to glory, but it is much more than that. The movie takes a deep dive into the emotions that come with competition, both on the positive and negative end.

      <p>If anything, <i>Umamusume: Pretty Derby — Beginning of a New Era</i> is more of a self-discovery story. Envy, pride, and anxiety, all of these emotions wholly consume Jungle Pocket at different points in the film. Jungle Pocket's gradual maturation is incredibly compelling, as a result. Her biggest win is actually from a mental battle with herself, and it's refreshing to see something like that explored in depth. Now, the climax of the film probably could have used more build-up, but, overall, the movie offers a fairly complete narrative.</p>
