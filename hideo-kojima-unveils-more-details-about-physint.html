            <br> 
            <p>Hideo Kojima has reaffirmed that he is currently working on his next big tactical espionage action game, currently titled <strong style="color: #b4cbc2"><i>PHYSINT</i></strong>. At the moment, Kojima confessed that <i>PHYSINT</i> is still in its planning stage, but his studio, Kojima Productions, is taking as much initiative as it currently can. Character casting is ongoing, with the confirmation of a few actors being the biggest news so far.</p>

            <h2>Charlee Fraser, Don Lee, and Minami Hamabe Join The PHYSINT Cast</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>PHYSINT</i> might still need some work done to its overall structure, but Hideo Kojima already has some characters set in stone. We may not know what those roles are yet, but we do know the three actors that have been cast for those parts. Charlee Fraser, Don Lee (aka Ma Dong-seok), and Minami Hamabe will all be sharing their likeness in <i>PHYSINT</i>.</p>

            <p>SAG-AFTRA strikes were apparently a major deterrent in earlier attempts to find actors for <i>PHYSINT</i>. Considering the game doesn't even have anyone set to play the main character just yet, it's readily apparent that there have been some major hurdles in the early development of <i>PHYSINT</i>.</p>

            <p>To actually address the main character situation, the man on the <i>PHYSINT</i> poster looks suspiciously a lot like <strong>Eddie Redmayne</strong>... Kojima says the actor behind that role can't be announced just yet, though. It may very well be someone else. For now, the only definitive members of the cast are the three aforementioned actors. Kojima is a big fan of each of the three, so he's more than happy to have them locked in.</p>

            <h2>Breaking The Barrier Between Movies And Games</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">Hideo Kojima's approach to game design has always been inspired by movies. Cutscenes in Kojima games have always had a cinematic feel to them. His more recent desire to bring in Hollywood actors isn't performative — it comes from a genuine love of the film industry. Kojima hopes to take things a step further with <i>PHYSINT</i>, almost sure that "it will break the barrier between movies and games."</p>

            <p>The technology powering PHYSINT is set to be truly cutting-edge, surpassing even <i>OD</i>, Kojima Productions' upcoming release. Kojima has placed a strong emphasis on innovative rendering — for example, insisting that only the latest advancements can authentically capture the unique beauty of Asian skin.</p>

            <p>A recent test capture of Minami Hamabe demonstrates this vision, reproducing the most authentic-looking model of an Asian person that the industry has seen so far. Kojima is highly invested in making his actors look as perfect as possible in-game.</p>

            <p><i>PHYSINT</i>, in all likelihood, will be exclusive to the PlayStation 6.</p>
