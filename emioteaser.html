            <p>A YouTube video with a one-word title isn't something that generally draws a lot of attention; but when it's coming from Nintendo and it's <b>age-restricted</b>, that certainly raises eyebrows. Horror isn't exactly Nintendo's forte which is why there's a lot of buzz going around about this newly teased game. It's just really unexpected. And the thing is, all signs point to this being an important project for Nintendo. Not a whole lot of third-party games get their
              <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/emio/index.html" target="_blank">own promotional page</a> on the Nintendo website. The immediate fan reaction reflects this; there's <i>a lot</i> of anticipation for the game already.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>So Who/What Is Emio?</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>Emio means "smiling man" in Japanese. While that sounds completely harmless, the only smiling man we're privy to is the creepy figure wearing a paper bag in the teaser. Yeah, I think we have our guy. He even shows off a more toothy grin every now and then...
            </p>

            <p>The "Mature" rating for the game makes it pretty evident that this isn't just some weird advertising gimmick for a completely unrelated game like some people have speculated. In fact, if you take a look at the <a href="https://youtu.be/h5uSd32MdOI?si=6UtCyYGqNYt_hzBm" target="_blank">Australian teaser</a>, it actually gives a bit more insight on the themes relevant to the game. Violence, cruelty, domestic abuse, and suicide themes â€”  yeah, the game isn't messing around. The creepy, supernatural
               aspects of the teaser aren't some facade.
            </p>

               <img src="images/emioteaser_grin.jpg" width="100%" class="center" alt="Emio changes his face and posture through a static cut">
            </div>
               
            <br>
            <p>Until a full-on trailer comes out, that's all we have available to comment on for the moment. While we could certainly speak about the rumors of Bloober Team being involved, that does a service to no one. While this could totally be the "Project M" that they mentioned a while back, speculation about this does more harm than good. Developers getting hate for a game that's hasn't even been properly announced yet just doesn't make sense. Let's just enjoy the potential of a Nintendo-directed
              horror game.
