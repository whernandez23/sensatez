            <br> 
            <p>What if Mister Fantastic used his intelligence for not-so-fantastic things? Well, you would have an incredibly dangerous supervillain to deal with, and that's exactly what The Maker is.
            </p>

            <p>While Reed Richards has had many different evil variants over the years, none have stood out quite as much as The Maker. It really is no surprise then that Mister Fantastic's The Maker costume is the first one available for him in <i>Marvel Rivals</i>. If you want an evil Reed, there's no one better for the job.
            </p>

            <p>As for how The Maker has been able to make such a big name for himself despite being relatively modern, it mainly comes down to how well-written the character is. The Maker is an eerily realistic interpretation of what could happen to a broken down Reed Richards. Mister Fantastic falling to the dark side really isn't a big stretch.</p>

            <h2>The Maker — No Love, No Humanity</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">The Maker is Reed Richards from Earth-1610, the home of Marvel's Ultimate Universe. The Ultimate Universe, in general, was known for being a lot more grim and edgy, but there was nothing inherently more evil about the universe's Reed Richards. His family situation was a lot rougher growing up, but this Reed would still end up becoming Mister Fantastic.</p> 

            <p>This Reed's fall from grace can mainly be attributed to being rejected by his universe's Susan Storm. Or rather, this event was what finally broke him. A lot of bad things would happen to this Reed in just a short period of time. His intelligence in this universe made him unable to cope with his problems in a human way. The path of pure hatred and killing would soon find him. Reed's descent would fully begin with him murdering his own family via an explosion.
            </p>

            <p>The Maker's official debut is honestly a bit contentious, but <i>Marvel Rivals</i> stands firmly on the idea that his first formal appearance was in <i>Ultimate Comics Ultimates (2011) #2.</i>. The Maker is defined by his twisted perception of reality. He's a perfectionist, and he sees the universe's existence as wholly imperfect. Control is necessary, and The Maker sees himself as the right man to define the world's proper order.</p>

            <p>The Maker is Marvel's greatest modern villain. Reed Richards is just one man from Earth, yet he alone can threaten the multiverse. The Maker's dynamic with his ex-teammates is interesting, but he makes a good foil to just about any hero in general. The Maker is genuinely dangerous. He's creepy and unsettling. He's relentless and (mostly) unforgiving. It's a bit sad that <i>Marvel Rivals</i> doesn't make the skin feel a little more unique, personality-wise.</p>

            <h2>The Maker's Iconic Design — There's A Reason For The Helmet</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">The Maker has a distinct look to him. The helmet's a bit clunky, but the character just <em>looks</em> like a threat. The design has a cold, heartless feel to it. In many ways, it's perfect for this version of Reed. By proxy of his powers, The Maker is also able to corrupt his appearance even further, which definitely adds to the creepy vibes. <i>Marvel Rivals</i> opted not to change much of the original design, because, in truth, it's already pretty perfect.
            </p>

            <p>As for why The Maker wears his signature helmet, it actually has various uses. For one, it protects his brain, which he obviously values above everything else. The Maker has literally expanded his brain to be more intelligent. He's definitely not going to leave that vulnerable. The Maker's helmet also happens to cover up his facial scarring. In a scuffle with Johnny Storm, Reed ended up getting his face permanently burnt. It's convenient then that his helmet is able to hide his identity despite that marking.</p>
