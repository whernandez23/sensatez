            <p><strong style="color: #92f46e;"><i>Shroom and Gloom</i></strong> is an indie game that fully embraces everything that makes roguelike deckbuilders feel so compelling. What makes this game feel particularly special is how it pushes the boundaries of the genre. It takes deck-building to the absolute extreme, by incorporating the mechanic into practically every action that you can perform in-game.
            </p>

            <p>While the first several minutes of the demo don't exactly offer the strongest impression, <i>Shroom and Gloom</i> definitely grows on you. Getting familiar with how the game works will change your perspective on it. And honestly, there really isn't much to complain about. <i>Shroom and Gloom</i> is anything but shallow, and the full game looks like it'll be the kind of experience you can truly lose yourself in.</p>

            <h2>A Card For Every Action, Both In And Out Of Combat</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">What makes <i>Shroom and Gloom</i> immediately stand out is its exploration deck, which serves the exact purpose that the name would suggest. Even when you're out of combat, your actions depend on what you do with your cards. This takes some getting used to, but it's a fun spin on the formula popularized by <i>Slay the Spire</i>. You technically end up with more control over your run; however, RNG will ultimately end up dictating everything you do.

            <p>Comparing <i>Shroom and Gloom</i> to <i>Slay the Spire</i> is very apt, as battles will feel very familiar. <i>Shroom and Gloom</i> doesn't honestly do too much to distinguish itself from the older roguelike, aside from putting a greater focus on consumables. Personally, I don't mind that, but the lack of creativity might bother some people. When it comes to this style of combat, though, the old saying 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' couldn't be any more fitting. It just works so well. <i>Shroom and Gloom</i> also does feel a bit harder, so it isn't dumbing the formula down or anything like that.

            <h2>Is The Gameplay Loop In Shroom And Gloom Built To Last?</h2> 

            <p class="arh2-spc">What sets the best roguelikes apart is their ability to keep players engaged for hours on end. Hundreds of hours. Thousands of hours. Does <i>Shroom and Gloom</i> have that kind of pull? It's a bit too early to tell. The demo just doesn't offer enough insight. The gameplay loop is convincing, but only on the surface level. The runs are fun, but there isn't much motivating you to come back for more. Things might be different in the full game. No, they <i>will</i> be different in the full game, so it's best not to speculate at this point.
