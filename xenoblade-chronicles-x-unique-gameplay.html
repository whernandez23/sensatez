            <p>With the re-release of <strong style="color: #0cddd7;"><i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i></strong>, every <i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i> game can now be played on the Nintendo Switch. <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> is fairly distinct from the rest of the series, though, and it's important to know that before going in. <i>X</i> simply has different priorities, <strong>focusing more on its gameplay</strong> rather than its narrative. After all, <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> is the closest that
               the series has gotten to being an MMORPG. <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> wants you exploring more than anything, and it has the kind of world that makes that an absolute delight to do.

            <h2><i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i>: The Pseudo-MMO</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> is huge. Actually quantifying that size is pretty hard, but <i>X</i> is the kind of the game that can easily take you well over 100 hours to beat. The game has so much to explore that you could even find yourself spending 300+ hours on <i>X</i> trying to finish every little quest. There is no pressure on players to accomplish anything specific, so it ends up being a very relaxed experience overall.
            </p>

            <p>The scope of the game aside, <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> has plenty of other traditional MMORPG elements. A central hub, character classes, boss raids, and lots of freedom in the world, the game hits a lot of the genre's usuals markers. Of course, <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> doesn't emphasize multiplayer or online features, but they do exist within the game. Squad Missions add more life to the world of <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i>; though, they really aren't that important.</p>

            <p><i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> isn't an MMO, but it can definitely scratch that same itch, if you like those kinds of games. Inversely, if you're not a big fan of MMOs, <i>X</i> still appeals to a lot of the same qualities that make the other <i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i> games feel so good.</p>

            <h2>Unique Gameplay Elements (Relative To The Franchise)</h2>

            <p class="arh2-spc">A few things make <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> feel unique from the rest of the series when it comes to the actual combat. Undoubtedly, what stands out the most in <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> are the game's <b>Skells</b>, which are weaponizable mechs that can be used in and out of battles. They are essential assets in most fights after the early-game, but they also serve as a means of transportation. Exploration is incredibly fun in <i>X</i> because Skells make the entire world so easily accessible. 
            </p>

            <p><strong>Overdrive</strong> is the stand-in, snowball mechanic for chain attacks in <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i>. Instead of slowing down the game, Overdrive actually wants you to pick up the pace. The mechanic boosts the damage of your attacks and speeds up the cooldown of your arts, as well. The game wants you to combo your arts when in Overdrive to maximize your total output. Overdrive is such a complex mechanic that it's honestly impossible to detail it all here.</p>

            <p>This isn't exactly a feature per se, but <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</i> has 20+ playable characters. That beats out the playable rosters of other <i>Xenoblade</i> games by a wide margin. This isn't a super important quality, but it does add more depth to a game that really appreciates it. <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> stresses the solitary nature of humanity on Planet Mira, which makes the extra party members feel extra comforting.</p>
