      <p>Back in 2015, Hideo Kojima's exit from Konami seemed like a definitive end to the <i>Metal Gear</i> series. The release of the widely panned <i>Metal Gear Survive</i> a few years later didn't help in that regard, only solidifying the idea that the series had no future without its original creator. But now in 2025, <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i> has given the franchise a clear second chance. Not only is the remake an incredibly well-executed return to form, but it has fully revived interest in the tactical espionage niche that the series once defined.</p>

      <h2>Enjoyability: 10/12 — A Bizarre Adventure</h2>
      <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i> is about as unserious as a serious espionage thriller can get. Stealth games aren't exactly known for their ability to keep players both fully engaged <em>and</em> entertained, but <i>Snake Eater</i> — and the majority of <i>Metal Gear</i> games — have such a great understanding of how to appeal to as many emotions as possible without losing their sense of identity. <i>Snake Eater</i> gets completely outlandish at times, but it works. The shameless cheesiness just adds to the game's charm.</p>

      <p>What makes <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i> further stand out in terms of enjoyability is its lack of common stealth pitfalls. The game never feels like it has an iron grip over what you do. Freedom is important in anything stealth-related, and you get a lot of that in <i>Snake Eater</i>. There isn't an overreliance on waiting, which helps the experience a lot. The greater focus on Snake's selection of tools and camo outfits makes for a more satisfying game. Stealth isn't fun without a strong sense of immersion, and <i>Snake Eater</i> really does let you play like you're a special op.</p>

      <h2>Gameplay: 11/12 — Real Smooth Snake</h2> 
      <p class="arh2-spc"><i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i> offers an incredibly memorable stealth action experience. Not everything feels perfectly refined, but it has everything that you could want out of a stealth-focused game. An easy-to-understand detection system, various methods of hiding, true player agency, and a diverse selection of tools, <i>Snake Eater</i> lets you feel genuinely empowered.

      <p><i>Snake Eater</i> may be a stealth game first and foremost, but the combat is more than adequate. The weapons feel great to control. CQC is also a very strong attacking alternative when up-close, essential for true stealth runs. The ideal way to play <i>Snake Eater</i> actually involves as little killing as possible. The game gives you more than enough options to accomplish this, but it's not a strict requirement unless you're on higher difficulties. By all means, you can play however you want. Even the most mundane items have some kind of  utility.</p>

      <p>The addition of a new control scheme in <i>Delta: Snake Eater</i> is a huge blessing, because it honestly does elevate the remake over the original. The New Style control scheme offers full freedom of movement with a modern third-person, over-the-shoulder perspective. Even still, some actions are clunky, but it's a much smoother experience. Stealth is so much easier when you have almost full control over what you see. <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i> was also made with mouse-and-keyboard players in mind, so <i>Snake Eater</i> finally feels good to play with that set of controls.</p>

      <h2>Atmosphere: 12/12 — The Jungle's Alive</h2>  
      <p class="arh2-spc">There's something about the environments of <i>Snake Eater</i> that makes them special. Their distinctly natural feel is impressive, but there's more to it than that. In a way, they feel alive. Not just because they house moving NPCs like animals and enemy guards, but because the terrain itself demands awareness. Every single environment has something to engage with. Secret paths, hidden traps, patches of grass to hide in — the environments are just as important to the game as the weapons in Snake's arsenal.</p> 

      <p>The remake only adds to the game's inherent beauty, deepening the visual impact. <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i> doesn't just excel in terms of its visuals, however. The sound design is also stellar, crucial for a game of its nature. The overall vibe of <i>Snake Eater</i> is uniquely immersive, unmistakably a Kojima production. That personality serves the game well, making it unforgettable.</p>

      <h2>Design: 12/12 — They Thought Of Everything</h2> 
      <p class="arh2-spc">Stealth games can't succeed without good game design. There are just too many elements that need to be working in perfect harmony. Comparing <i>Snake Eater</i> to the average stealth game just isn't fair, though.</p>

      <p><i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i> goes well beyond the fundamentals. The enemy AI is very solid. The camouflage system is super engaging. The maps are well-crafted for everything that players could ever want to do. The unique character interactions, especially, show off the extraordinary amount of detail that went into the creation of this game. <i>Snake Eater</i> is a masterpiece in game design, with its heavy ambitions fully realized.</p>

      <h2>Direction: 10/12 — An Immersive Movie At Heart</h2> 
      <p class="arh2-spc">Kojima's love for movies is on full display in <i>Snake Eater</i>. The often lengthy cutscenes make that more than apparent. That's not necessarily to the game's detriment, but the storytelling is a bit of a weak point at times. There are moments where the game just gives you too much information to process. With how many names and code names get thrown around, it can be hard to keep track of what's going on. It can be hard to truly feel the weight of the circumstances.</p>

      <p>Beneath all the talking, though, <i>Snake Eater</i> does offer a gripping story. Sure, it can get a little silly, but the way it approaches some truly somber themes is absolutely brilliant. Honestly, the journey is every bit as powerful as the destination. <i>Snake Eater</i> has a really strong conclusion, but it only feels properly rewarding because of all the prior buildup. The story is just about perfectly paced, with each progressing mission feeling increasingly captivating and significant.</p>

      <p>It's hard to talk about <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i> without ultimately praising the original game. The remake stays almost completely true to the OG <i>Snake Eater</i>. That's far from a bad thing. This remake does a fantastic job of honoring the original's legacy, even improving on it.</p>

      <p>I do have to say, though, that <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i> does leave you wondering if the series has more to offer. Who knows, maybe this remake team has a new story they'd love to tell. They've more than earned the right to take a stab at it. There's definitely room for a Snake in our world today.</p>
