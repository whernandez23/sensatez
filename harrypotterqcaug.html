            <br> 
            <p>Warner Bros. Games' newest Portkey Games title, <i>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</i>, is
              on the horizon with the initial release date set for September 3, 2024. The official gameplay
              trailer has given insight to the quidditch mechanics and the recent Triwizard Schools Showcase
              trailer gave audiences a peak at the quidditch pitches for Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and
              Durmstrang. Since this release is still on the heels of the incredibly well-received, <i>Hogwarts
              Legacy</i>, expectations are high and so is the criticism.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>The General Consensus â€” We've Been Here Before</h2> 
            <br>

            <p>The biggest critique to be gleaned from the official trailer is the gameplay direction taken by the
              developers at Unbroken Studios. <i>Hogwarts Legacy</i> featured enjoyable broomstick
              flying and, coupled with the open world, the spirit of freedom and adventure was a breath of fresh
              air compared to the more simplistic style seen in past games. It set a precedent for what flying
              could be in a <i>Harry Potter</i> game.</p>

            <p>Despite those developments, <i>Quidditch Champions</i>
              appears to be a return to the playstyle seen in previous games, namely the 2003 game <i>Harry
              Potter: Quidditch World Cup</i>. Since <i>Hogwarts Legacy</i> did not integrate quidditch, the
              decision to use decades old mechanics and create a stand-alone game (as opposed to a DLC
              which has been widely suggested) has spurred disappointment in many fans even as early as the
              game's playtest sign ups in April 2023.</p>

            <p>The trailer itself, while short, reveals enough of the gameplay to warrant the critiques it's
              received. Magical barriers around the pitch seem to limit the player to areas within the arena and
              the recycled flying-through-rings mechanic to catch the Golden Snitch ultimately takes away the
              sense of freedom that we got a taste of in <i>Hogwarts Legacy</i>. While most of the footage is
              played through the perspective of a Chaser, the latest Triwizard Schools Showcase trailer does
              expand upon the gameplay with POVs from the Beaters and longer snippets of a livelier looking
              match. This improves upon <i>Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup</i> where you could only
              play as the Chasers during matches, however, that is arguably expected given the 2 decades of
              time between these games.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>Canonical Elements...Kind of?</h2> 
            <br>

            <p><i>Quidditch Champions</i> is set to feature a single-player career mode as well as online
              competitive play. You will be able to choose from any of the 4 positions (Keeper, Chaser, Beater,
              or Seeker) and from Hogwarts students we know and love, including Cho Chang, Draco Malfoy,
              Ron Weasley, and The Chosen One himself. Interestingly, you can decide to create and
              customize your own character and equipment, suggesting a highly personalized career mode. The
              use of our regular cast of characters may hint to some story-based or story-adjacent challenges.
            </p>

            <p>Gameplay footage shows us that some sort of time limit will be placed on the matches (which
              fans will know is not how quidditch games are meant to end) but this is clearly a means to foster
              playability. Other story elements are present with The Burrow and 1994 Quidditch World Cup
              arenas, but the online multiplayer experience is clearly the focus of this game.</p>

            <p>Upgrades to your broom's Speed, Durability, and Agility stats, presumably to support the varying
              positions' needs, will be available along with different broom skins. Warner Bros. has stated that
              there are no plans to include microtransactions but so far there has been no word on whether or
              not there will be a ranking system or some other method of supporting fair co-op. The game will
              support cross-platform play but local multiplayer does not appear to be an option.</p>

            <p>What all three trailers do highlight is that there will be a return to the main timeline centered
              around Harry & Co (most likely Harry's 6th year). With the presence of familiar faces such as the
              Weasleys, Viktor Krum, Cho Chang, and story-based locations like Beauxbatons and
              Durmstrang, it's obvious that the developers have made some attempt to invoke the source
              material. For Potterheads like myself, this is the game's leading positive factor, along with the
              customization that lends itself to the immersive Wizarding World experience we all crave.</p>

            </div>
            <br>

            <p>While we all love to see the characters that we know so well, the fan service comes off a little superficial.
              The brightly colored and distinct artistic direction make it clear that the intention for this game is
              light-hearted fun so there is surely still entertainment value, but the stylistic gameplay decisions
              have rendered general expectations of the game relatively low. We may be looking at something
              more akin to an arcade/minigame style installment with limited replayability.</p>

            <p>There might just be too much room to compare <i>Quidditch Champions</i> to the pioneering
              <i>Hogwarts Legacy</i>, particularly due to its notable absence of quidditch. The bar has been
              set pretty high and the clear departure in style may be a subtle nod to point our expectations in
              the right direction. Only time will tell what this game truly has to offer.</p>
